*The associated study guide for this factsheet is [Guide: Introduction to logarithms](../studyguides/logarithms.qmd). If you would like to know more about logarithms, please read the guide.*

Throughout this factsheet, $a,k, x,$ and $y$ are positive real numbers, and $n$ is a real number, with $a, k \neq 1$.

## Laws of logarithms {-}

**Law 1 - Product Rule**: $$\log_a(x) + \log_a(y) = \log_a(xy)$$


**Law 2 - Quotient Rule**: $$\log_a(x) - \log_a(y) = \log_a(\frac{x}{y})$$


**Law 3 - Power Rule**: $$\log_a(x^n) = n\log_a(x)$$


**Law 4 - Zero Rule**: $$\log_a(1) = 0$$


**Law 5 - Identity Rule**: $$\log_a(a) = 1$$


**Law 6 - Change of Base Rule**: $$\log_a(x) = \frac{\log_k(x)}{\log_k(a)}$$
