*Before attempting these questions, it is highly recommended that you read the guide 'Introduction to rearranging equations with trig and logs' *

## Q1 {-}

Solve each of these equations assuming we are using radians as our angle unit.

1.1 $sin(x)=\frac{\sqrt2}{2}$ 
1.2 $cos(2x+1)=\frac{1}{2}$
1.3 $tan(5x-1)=\frac{\sqrt2}{2}$
1.4 $cos(x^2+4x+3)=1$

## Q2 {-}

Using that $1+\cot^2(x)=\csc^2(x)$, prove that $\sin^2(x)+\cos^2(x)=1$.

## Q3 {-}

Solve these logarithmic equations

3.1 $6\log_3(x)+\log_3(5)=9$ 
3.2 $\log_2{16x}=6$ 
3.3 $e^{\ln(3x)}=y$ Find y in terms of x.

## Q4 {-}

Solve these simultaneous equations
$$2^y=4x-7$$
and $$\log_2(x)=y$$
