*Before attempting these questions, it is highly recommended that you read [Guide: Sigma Notation](sigmanotation.qmd).*

## Q1 {-}

Calculate the value of the following. You may use the properties of sums but they should not be necessary.

1.1 $$\sum_{i = 1}^{10} 2i$$

1.2 $$\sum_{i = 2}^{11} i$$

1.3 $$\sum_{i = 3}^{6} 3i$$

1.4 $$\sum_{i = 1}^{5} i^3$$

1.5 $$\sum_{i = 2}^{6} 5i^2$$

1.6 $$\sum_{i = 3}^{6} 2$$

1.7 $$\sum_{i = 1}^{6} j$$

## Q2 {-}

Express the following using sigma notation. Note that there are multiple correct answers for some of the questions. It is recommended to use i as your variable so that your answers will align with those provided.

2.1 $3 + 6 + 9 + 12$

2.2 $- 1 - 2 - 3 - 4$

2.3 $0 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81$

2.4 $1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1$

2.5 $6 - 12 + 18 - 24$

2.6 $8 + 16 + 12 + 4$

2.7 $25 + 20 + 15 + 10 + 5$

## Q3 {-}

Using the properties listed in the guide write the following sums in their simplest form i.e. with as little as possible within the summation.

3.1 $$\sum_{i = 1}^{n} 2i$$

3.2 $$\sum_{i = 1}^{n} 2i + \sum_{j = 1}^{n} 2i$$

3.3 $$\sum_{i = 0}^{n} 4i + \sum_{i = 1}^{n} 2i$$

3.4 $$\sum_{i = 2}^{n} 2i - \sum_{i = 1}^{n} i$$

## Q4 {-}

I am leaving double sums until the examples are finished

## Q5 {-}

Simplify the following:

5.1 $$\sum_{i = 1}^{n} (i-1)(2i+1)$$

5.2 $$\sum_{i = 1}^{n} i(i+3)(i+6)$$

5.3 $$\sum_{i = 1}^{n} i(2i-3)(3i+1)$$
