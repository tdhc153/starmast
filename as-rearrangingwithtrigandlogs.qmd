## Q1 {-}
Solve the trigonometric equations in radians. Answers are given in exact for

1.1 For $sin(x)=\frac{\sqrt2}{2}$, x is equal to $\frac{\pi}{2}$ or 0.785.
1.2 For $cos(2x+1)=\frac{1}{2}$, x is equal to $\frac{\pi-3}{6}$ or 0.0234.
1.3 For $tan(5x-1)=\frac{\sqrt2}{2}$, x is equal to 0.323.
1.4 For $cos(x^2+4x+3)=1$, x is equal to -1 or -3. To do this, you use that $cos^{-1}(1)=0$ and so you need to solve the quadratic equation $x^2+4x+3=0$.
