## Q1 {-}
Solve the trigonometric equations in radians. 

1.1 For $sin(x)=\frac{\sqrt2}{2}$, x is equal to $\frac{\pi}{2}$ or 1.57.

1.2 For $cos(2x+1)=\frac{1}{2}$, x is equal to $\frac{\pi-3}{6}$ or 0.0234.

1.3 For $tan(5x-1)=\frac{\sqrt2}{2}$, x is equal to 0.323.

1.4 For $cos(x^2+4x+3)=1$, x is equal to -1 or -3. To do this, you use that $cos^{-1}(1)=0$ and so you need to solve the quadratic equation $x^2+4x+3=0$. 


## Q2 {-}

Rewrite $\cot$ and $\csc$ in terms of $\sin$, $\cos$, and $\tan$

$1+\frac{1}{\tan^2(x)}=\frac{1}{\sin^2(x)}$

$1+\frac{\cos^2(x)}{\sin^2(x)}=\frac{1}{\sin^2(x)}$

Then, multiply both sides of the equation by $\sin^2(x)$

$\sin^2(x)+\cos^2(x)=1$. 

## Q3 {-}

Rewriting $5\cos(x)+9\sin(x)$ gives $\sqrt{106}\sin(x+0.507)$. Setting this equal to 10 and solving gives $x= 0.823$. If you have a slightly different answer, this may be due to rounding at different points in the process.

## Q4 {-}

4.1 $a=6$, $b=36$, $c=2$.

4.2 $a=3$, $b=2187$, $c= 2187$.

4.3 $a=e$, $b=y$, $c=x$.

4.4 $a=2$, $b=9$, $c=3.17...$.

4.5 $a=2$, $b=4$, $c=2$.

## Q5 {-}

5.1 The solution to $6\log_3(x)+\log_3(5)=9$  is $x=\sqrt[6]{\frac{3^9}{5}}$, or approximately 3.97.

5.2 The solution to $\log_2(16x)=6$ is $x=4$.

5.3 If $e^{\ln(3x)}=y$, then $y=3x$. 

## Q6 {-}

Firstly, substitute y into the first equation. This gives $2^{\log_2(x)}=4x-7$. Via example 7, you can see that this means $x=4x-7$. Rearranging this gives $x=\frac{7}{3}$ or approximately 2.33.  Plugging this into the second equation gives $y=\log_2(\frac{7}{3})$ or approximately 1.22.

## Q7 {-}

7.1 If $e^{-x}+3e^x=12$, then multiply everything by $e^x$ and define y such that $e^x=y$. This makes $1+3y^2=12y$ and solving this gives $y=\frac{6\pm \sqrt{33}}{3}$. Then, $\ln(y)=x= 1.36$ or $-2.46$. 

7.2 Using the same method detailed above $y=\frac{9\pm \sqrt{65}{8}}$ and $x=0.757$ or $-2.144$.

## Q8 {-}

8.1 If $\log_{16}(x)=\log_2(y)$, then $y=x^{\frac{1}{4}}$.

8.2 If $\log_{3}(x)=\log_{27}(y)$ , then $y=x^3$.

8.3 If $\log_9(x)+\log_3(2x)=6$, then $\log_9(x)=\log_3(x^{\frac{1}{2}})$. Substituting gives $\log_3(2x^{\frac{3}{2}})=6$, thus $3^6=2x^{\frac{3}{2}}$. This means that $x=51.0$.
