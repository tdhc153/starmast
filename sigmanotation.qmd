## What is sigma notation? {-}

If you want to add many things together, then it would be nice to have a quick way of writing this down! This is where **sigma notation** comes in.

## Definition of sum and sigma notation

A **sum** is any addition of two or more real numbers. If $a_k,a_{k+1}, \ldots, a_n$ are real numbers (where $k$ and $n$ are some natural numbers with $k\leq N$), then you can use **sigma notation** to write their sum as $$a_k + a_{k+1} + \ldots + a_N = \sum_{i = k}^N a_i$$ where the right hand side reads 'the sum from $i = k$ to $i = n$ of the elements $a_i$'. The symbol $i$ is known as the **index** of the sum; the index of a sum can notionally be any letter.

#### Examples {-}

Here's some examples of sigma notation.

## Example 1

What is the value of $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{10} i$?

  You can use the definition above to write this out as a sum and then calculate it: $$\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{10} i = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 +9 + 10 = 55.$$

## Example 2
What is the value of $\displaystyle\sum_{n=2}^5 n^2$?
    
  Before tackling a problem using sigma notation, it can be best to read it out loud. Here, $$\sum_{n=2}^5 n^2\textsf{ is 'the sum from $n = 2$ to $n = 5$ of $n^2$'.}$$ This translates to $$\sum_{n=2}^5 n^2 = 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2$$ and $2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 = 54$.

## Example 3
What is the value of $\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^N n = S$?

  In this case, you're being asked to find $S = 1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + N$. The following method is due to [Gauss](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Gauss/), who came up with this answer during a maths lesson at school when he was seven (hinting at the genius to follow).

  First of all, you can reorder $S$ to write that $S = N + (N-1) + \ldots + 2 + 1$. Adding two lots of $S$ together gives the following:

$$
\begin{array}{cccccccccccc}
& S & = & 1 & + & 2 & + & 3 & + & \ldots & + & N \\
+ & S & = & N & + & (N-1) & + & (N-2) & + & \ldots & + & 1\\\hline
& 2S & = & (N+1) & + & (N+1) & + & (N+1) & + & \ldots & + & (N+1)
\end{array}
$$

  Therefore, $2S$ is $N$ lots of $(N+1)$; you can write this as $2S = N(N+1)$. Dividing both sides by $2$ gives $S = N(N+1)/2$.

## Writing sums using sigma notation

In this section, you will learn how the opposite of the above. That is, given a sequence of numbers, you will learn how to write their sum using sigma notation. The crux of this process is to recognise a pattern in the sequence of given numbers. It's best to teach this using examples:

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Example 1

Write $2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12$ using sigma notation.
    
  You can tell that these are the first six multiples of $2$; so you can list these elements as $2n$ for $n = 1$ up to $n = 6$. Therefore, you can write that $$2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 = \sum_{n=1}^6 2n.$$

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"} 
## Example 2
Write $1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32$ using sigma notation.

  These are the first 6 numbers in the sequence $2^n$ for $n=0$ up to $n=5$. Therefore, you can write that $$1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 32 = \sum_{n=0}^5 2^n.$$

## Example 3

Write $-1 + 2 -3 + 4 - 5$ using sigma notation.

  For these types of sequences, it's useful to keep in mind the sequence $(-1)^n$, which alternates between $1$ and $-1$. Hence, you can write these elements as $(-1)^nn$ for $n=1$ up to $n=5$. Using sigma notation, it will look like this: $$\sum_{n=1}^5 (-1)^nn.$$

## Additional sums

A **sum** is any addition of two or more real numbers. If $a_k,a_{k+1}, \ldots, a_n$ are real numbers (where $k$ and $n$ are some natural numbers with $k\leq N$), then you can use **sigma notation** to write their sum as $$a_k + a_{k+1} + \ldots + a_N = \sum_{i = k}^N a_i$$ where the right hand side reads 'the sum from $i = k$ to $i = n$ of the elements $a_i$'. The symbol $i$ is known as the **index** of the sum; the index of a sum can notionally be any letter.
