#### Update {-}

It's heating up here at STARMAST with two new guides today!! ðŸ’«

The topics are on conditional probability and the law of total probability and Bayes' Theorem and are written by Sophie Chowgule, a participant in the University of St Andrews VIP project in Semester 1 and 2 2024/25.

The links to the guides, questions and answers can be found here:

- [Guide: Conditional probability](../studyguides/conditionalprobability.qmd)
- [Questions: Conditional probability](../questions/qs-conditionalprobability.qmd)
- [Answers: Conditional probability](../answers/as-conditionalprobability.qmd)

Â 

- [Guide: Law of total probability and Bayes' theorem](../studyguides/bayestheorem.qmd)
- [Questions: Law of total probability and Bayes' theorem](../questions/qs-bayestheorem.qmd)
- [Answers: Law of total probability and Bayes' theorem](../answers/as-bayestheorem.qmd)

and here is the link to the accompanying proof sheet for the guide on law of total probability and Bayes' theorem:

- [Proof: Law of total probability and Bayes' theorem](../proofsheets/ps-bayestheorem.qmd)

A big thank you to Sophie for writing these materials!

Stay tuned for more content coming soon, as we keep adding to our ever-growing bank of resources!
