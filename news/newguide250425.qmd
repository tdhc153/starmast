#### Update {-}

It's new guide here at STARMAST, and it has come with some new toys to play with! ðŸ’«

The topic is on introduction to hypothesis testing and is written by Ellie Trace, a participant in the University of St Andrews VIP project in Semester 1 2024/25. Included in the guide, and new to STARMAST, is the addition of **interactive flowcharts** and **statistical calculators**, written in R Shiny. Keep an eye out for more of these fantastic interactive elements on the site!

The links to the guide, questions and answers can be found here:

- [Guide: Introduction to hypothesis testing](../studyguides/hypothesistesting.qmd)
- [Questions: Introduction to hypothesis testing](../questions/qs-hypothesistesting.qmd)
- [Answers: Introduction to hypothesis testing](../answers/as-hypothesistesting.qmd)

and here are the links to the standalone interactive elements used in the guide:

- [Calculator: $Z$-testing](../apps/calculators/c-ztesting.qmd)
- [Interactive: Hypothesis testing flowchart](../apps/interactive/i-hypothesistesting.qmd)

A big thank you to Ellie for writing these materials.

Stay tuned for more content coming soon, as we roll out our audio narration for the rest of our study guides, *and* keep adding to our ever-growing bank of resources!
