#### Audio guides {-}

After six months of work, we at STARMAST have managed to develop automatically generated mp3 narration of our resources, which will be available for download on every study guide. 

This development has been led by Sophie Chowgule, a student in both Semester 1 and 2 of the University of St Andrews VIP project. Availability of these resources represents a big step forward in our drive to make mathematics and statistics resources accessible to all.

Narrations are now available on the following guides:

- [Guide: Introduction to sigma notation](../studyguides/sigmanotation.qmd)
- [Guide: Introduction to solving simultaneous equations](../studyguides/introtosimeqs.qmd)

We are working on making these available on all of our guides; stay tuned for more updates!

A huge thank you to Sophie for developing the workflow to make these mp3s possible. 

#### New guide {-}

It's also new guide time here at STARMAST! The topic is on introduction to differentiation and the derivative, written by tdhc; with questions and answers written by Sara Delgado Garcia, a student in the University of St Andrews VIP project in Semester 2 2024/25. The online versions of the guides are equipped with interactive figures powered by Desmos. 

The links to the guide, questions and answers can be found here:

- [Guide: Introduction to differentiation and the derivative](../studyguides/introtodifferentiation.qmd)
- [Questions: Introduction to differentiation and the derivative](../questions/qs-introtodifferentiation.qmd)
- [Answers: Introduction to differentiation and the derivative](../answers/as-introtodifferentiation.qmd)

In addition, there is a proof sheet that explains derivatives of common functions from first principles; see [Proof sheet: Derivatives of functions from first principles](../proofsheets/ps-introtodifferentiation.qmd).

A big thank you to Sara for writing these materials.

Stay tuned for more content coming soon, including our (long-awaited) first guides on statistics -- finally putting the last ST in STARMAST!
