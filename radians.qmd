## What are Radians? {-}

**Radians**, like Degrees are a way of measuring angles. Radians can usually be identified by the prescence of **$\pi$.**

Radians are derived from the **radius of a circle** which makes them especially useful when working with circles. You will see this relationship more in the following section.

Radians are denoted by the symbol rad. 

This guide will firstly describe the relationship between Radians and Circles. Then describe the relationship between Radians and Degrees showing how to convert between them.Lastly, it will provide a table of some useful Degree to Radian conversions for common angle sizes.

## Converting between Radians and Degrees

The process for converting from Radians to Degrees and from Degrees to Radians are direct opposites.

### Converting from Degrees to Radians

Starting from an angle in degrees.

- Multiply the angle in degrees by $\pi$
- Divide the result by 180

Your angle is now in Radians. It is important to remember to simplify fractions.

#### Example 1

You are given the angle $180\textdegree$.

- Multipying by $\pi$ gives $180\pi$
- Dividing by 180 gives $\pi$

This means that $180\textdegree$ is equal to $\pi$ rad.

#### Example 2

You are given the angle $45\textdegree$.

- Multipying by $\pi$ gives $45\pi$
- Dividing by 180 gives $\frac{\pi}{4}$

This means that $45\textdegree$ is equal to $\frac{\pi}{4}$ rad.

### Converting from Radians to Degrees

Starting from an angle in Radians.

- Multiply the angle in Radians by 180
- Divide the result by $\pi$

Your angle is now in degrees

#### Example 3

You are given the angle $\pi$rad.

- Multipying by 180 gives $180\pi$
- Dividing by $\pi$ gives 180

This means that $\pi$rad is equal to $180\textdegree$.

#### Example 4

You are given the angle $\frac{\pi}{4}$rad

- Multipying by 180 gives $45\pi$
- Dividing by $\pi$ gives 45

This means that $\frac{\pi}{4}$rads is equal to  $45\textdegree$.
