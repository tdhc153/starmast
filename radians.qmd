## What are Radians? {-}

**Radians**, like Degrees are a way of measuring angles. Radians can usually be identified by the prescence of **$\pi$.**

Radians are derived from the **radius of a circle** which makes them especially useful when working with circles. You will see this relationship more in the following section.

Radians are denoted by the symbol rad. 

This guide will firstly describe the relationship between Radians and Circles. Then describe the relationship between Radians and Degrees showing how to convert between them.Lastly, it will provide a table of some useful Degree to Radian conversions for common angle sizes.

## Converting between Radians and Degrees

The process for converting from Radians to Degrees and from Degrees to Radians are direct opposites.

### Converting from Degrees to Radians

Starting from an angle in degrees.

- Multiply the angle in degrees by $\pi$
- Divide the result by 180

Your angle is now in radians

#### Example 1

You are given the angle 180 in degrees.

- Multipying by $\pi$ gives $180\pi$
- Dividing by 180 gives $\pi$

This means that 180 degrees is equal to $\pi$ Radians.-

#### Example 2

You are given the angle 45 in degrees.

- Multipying by $\pi$ gives $45\pi$
- Dividing by 180 gives $\frac{\pi}{4}$

This means that 45 degrees is equal to $\frac{\pi}{4}$ Radians.
