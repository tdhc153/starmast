## What are Radians? {-}

**Radians**, like Degrees are a way of measuring the size of angles that can often be identified by the presence of **$\pi$.**

Radians are derived from the **radius of a circle** which makes them especially useful when working with circles. You will see this relationship more in the following section.

Radians are denoted by the symbol **rad**. 

This guide will firstly describe the relationship between Radians and Circles. Then describe the relationship between Radians and Degrees showing how to convert between them. Lastly, it will provide a table of some useful Degree to Radians conversions for common angle sizes.

## Converting between Radians and Degrees

The process for converting from Radians to Degrees and from Degrees to Radians are direct opposites.

### Converting from Degrees to Radians

Starting from an angle in Degrees.

- Multiply the angle in Degrees by $\pi$
- Divide the result by 180

Your angle is now in Radians. 

**Remember to simplify fractions**

#### Example 1

You are given the angle $180\textdegree$ to convert to Radians.

- Multipying by $\pi$ gives $180\pi$
- Dividing by 180 gives $\pi$

This means that $180\textdegree$ is equal to $\pi$ rad.

#### Example 2

You are given the angle $45\textdegree$ to convert to Radians.

- Multiplying by $\pi$ gives $45\pi$
- Dividing by 180 gives $\frac{\pi}{4}$

This means that $45\textdegree$ is equal to $\frac{\pi}{4}$ rad.

### Converting from Radians to Degrees

Starting from an angle in Radians.

- Multiply the angle in Radians by 180
- Divide the result by $\pi$

Your angle is now in Degrees.

#### Example 3

You are given the angle $\pi$ rad to convert to Degrees.

- Multiplying by 180 gives $180\pi$
- Dividing the result by $\pi$ gives 180

This means that $\pi$ rad is equal to $180\textdegree$.

#### Example 4

You are given the angle $\frac{\pi}{4}$ rad to convert to degrees

- Multiplying by 180 gives $45\pi$
- Dividing the result by $\pi$ gives 45

This means that $\frac{\pi}{4}$ rad is equal to  $45\textdegree$.
