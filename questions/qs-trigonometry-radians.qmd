*Before attempting these questions, it is recommended that you read [Guide: Trigonometry (radians)](../studyguides/trigonometry-radians.qmd)*

## Q1 {-}

You are given the triangle below.

![Q1. Triangle](./FiguresPNG/trig-triangle-q1-1.png){width=300}

Find $\cos$, $\sin$ and $\tan$ of both $a$ and $b$. 


<!-- 1.1.  What is cos($a$)? What is tan($a$)? -->

<!-- 1.2.  What is sin($b$)? What is cos($b$)? -->

<!-- 1.3.  What is angle $a$? -->

<!-- 1.4.  What is angle $b$? -->


## Q2 {-}

Using the triangle below, solve the following equations.

![Q2. Triangle](./FiguresPNG/trig-triangle-q3-2.png){width=300}


2.1.  If angle $a$ is $\pi/6$ and $B = 6$, what length is $C$?

2.2.  If angle $b$ is $\pi/4$ and $C = 2\sqrt{2}$, what length is $A$?

2.3.  If angle $a$ is $\pi/12$ and $C = 7$, what length is $A$?

2.4.  If angle $b$ is $\pi/6$ and $C = 2\sqrt{2}$, what length is $A$?

2.5.  If angle $a$ is $\pi/4$ and $B = 8$, what length is $A$?

2.6.  If angle $a$ is $\pi/3$ and $A = 8$, what length is $B$?

<!-- 2.1.  If A = 8 and B = 10, what is angle a? -->

<!-- 2.2.  If C = 8 and B = 4, what is angle b? -->

<!-- 2.3.  If A = 4 and C = 7, what is angle a? -->

## Q3 {-}

Without using a calculator if possible, give the values of the following expressions.

3.1. $\cos(\pi/6)$

3.2. $\tan(\pi/6)$

3.3. $\csc(\pi/4)$

3.4. $\cot(\pi/6) - \sin(\pi/3)$

3.5. $\sin(\pi/2) + \cos(\pi)$

3.6. $\tan(\pi/6) - \cot(\pi/6)$

3.7. $\cos(0)\sin(\pi/2)$

3.8. $\cos(\pi/6)\sec(\pi/6) - \sin(\pi/4)\csc(\pi/4)$

3.9. $\cot(\pi/2)$
