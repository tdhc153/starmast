*Before attempting these questions it is highly recommended that you read [Guide: Law of total probability and Bayes’ theorem.](../studyguides/bayestheorem.qmd)*

## Q1 {-}

Use the law of total probability to answer the following.

#### 1.1. {-}

In a hospital:

* $40\%$ of patients are treated in Ward A,
* $60\%$ in Ward B,
* the probability of recovery within 3 days is $80\%$ in Ward A,
* the probability of recovery within 3 days is $60\%$ in Ward B. 

Let $R$ be the event that a patient recovers in 3 days. What is $\mathbb{P}(R)$?

#### 1.2. {-}

A school has three types of lunches:

* $50\%$ of students choose vegetarian  
* $30\%$ choose chicken  
* $20\%$ choose fish

The probability that a student finishes their lunch is:

* $90\%$ for vegetarian  
* $70\%$ for chicken  
* $80\%$ for fish  

What is the probability that a randomly chosen student finishes their lunch?

#### 1.3. {-}

The magnificent Mersenne Macarons are manufactured in three Cantor's Confectionery factories:

* $20\%$ from Factory 1 (with a defect rate $5\%$)  
* $30\%$ from Factory 2 (with a defect rate $2\%$)  
* $50\%$ from Factory 3 (with a defect rate $1\%$)

What is the probability that a randomly chosen Mersenne Macaron is defective?

#### 1.4. {-}

A student can study in three locations:

* At home ($50\%$ of the time)  
* In the library ($30\%$)  
* In a café ($20\%$)  

The probability they complete their homework is:

* $70\%$ at home  
* $90\%$ in the library  
* $60\%$ in the café

What is the probability that a randomly selected student completes their homework?

## Q2 {-}

Use Bayes’ theorem to answer the following.

#### 2.1. {-}

Statistics for a test for a disease is:

* $95\%$ accurate for infected individuals (true positive)  
* $90\%$ accurate for uninfected individuals (true negative)  
* $2\%$ of the population has the disease  

Let $D$ be the event that a person has the disease and $T$ the event they test positive. What is $\mathbb{P}(D \mid T)$?

#### 2.2. {-}

In St Andrews, Scotland:

* $60\%$ of days are dry  
* $40\%$ are rainy  

A forecast predicts rain:

* $80\%$ of the time on rainy days  
* $10\%$ of the time on dry days  

If the forecast predicts rain in St Andrews, what is the probability that it will actually rain?

#### 2.3. {-}

In a Cantor's Confectionery factory:

* $70\%$ of Bayes Biscuits are made by Machine A  
* $30\%$ by Machine B  

The probability of a broken Bayes Biscuit is:

* $2\%$ from Machine A  
* $5\%$ from Machine B  

If a biscuit is broken, what is the probability it came from Machine B?

#### 2.4. {-}

A brand new bag of Gauss Gummies contains:

* $40\%$ red sweets  
* $60\%$ blue sweets  

A red sweet has a $30\%$ chance of having a wrapper and a blue sweet has a $70\%$ chance of having a wrapper. If a sweet is picked at random and has a wrapper, what is the probability it is red?
