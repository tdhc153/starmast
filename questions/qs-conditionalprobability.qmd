*Before attempting these questions it is highly recommended that you read [Guide: Conditional Probability].*

## Q1 {-}

Answer the following using the definition of conditional probability.

#### 1.1. {-}

In a deck of $52$ cards, one card is drawn at random. Let $A$ be the event that the card is a heart, and $B$ the event that the card is red. What is the probability that the card is a heart, given that it is red?

#### 1.2. {-}

In a class:

* $60\%$ of students are left-handed  
* $25\%$ of left-handed students play the piano  

What is the probability that a randomly chosen student plays the piano, given that they are left-handed?

#### 1.3. {-}

In a class:

* $30\%$ of students take French,  
* $15\%$ of students take both French and Spanish.

Let $A$ be the event that a student takes Spanish, and $B$ the event that the student takes French. What is the probability that a student takes Spanish, given that they take French?

#### 1.4. {-}

The table below shows survey results about whether students bring a packed lunch and whether they are in Year 12:

|                       | Year 12 | Not Year 12 | Total |
|--------|------|------|------|
| **Packed lunch**          | 0.25    | 0.15         | 0.40   |
| **No packed lunch**       | 0.35    | 0.25         | 0.60   |
| **Total**                 | 0.60    | 0.40         | 1.00   |

Let $A$ be the event that a student is in Year 12, and $B$ the event that they bring a packed lunch. What is the probability that the student is Year 12, given they bring a packed lunch?

## Q2 {-}

Use the multiplication rule to solve the following problems.

#### 2.1. {-}

A bag contains $3$ green sweets and $2$ yellow sweets. Two sweets are picked one after the other without replacement. What is the probability that both sweets are green?

#### 2.2. {-}

In a factory:

* The probability a toy passes inspection is $0.9$  
* The probability it passes a second inspection given it passed the first is $0.95$

What is the probability that a toy passes both inspections?

#### 2.3. {-}

A coin is flipped, and then a die is rolled.

* The probability of getting heads on the coin is $0.5$  
* The probability of rolling a $6$ on the die is $1/6$

What is the probability of getting heads and rolling a $6$?

#### 2.4. {-}

In a survey:

* $70\%$ of people like tea  
* $60\%$ of tea-drinkers also like coffee

What is the probability that a randomly chosen person likes both tea and coffee?

## Q3 {-}

Decide whether the following events are independent.

#### 3.1. {-}

In a study:

* $P(A) = 0.4$  
* $P(B) = 0.5$  
* $P(A \cap B) = 0.2$

Are $A$ and $B$ independent? Justify your answer.

#### 3.2. {-}

Suppose $P(A) = 0.3$ and $P(A \mid B) = 0.3$. Are $A$ and $B$ independent? Justify your answer.

#### 3.3. {-}

Suppose $P(A) = 0.5$, $P(B) = 0.4$, and $P(A \cap B) = 0.1$. Are $A$ and $B$ independent? Justify your answer.

#### 3.4. {-}

Suppose $P(A) = 0.6$ and $P(A \mid B) = 0.2$. Are $A$ and $B$ independent? Justify your answer.
