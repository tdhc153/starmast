## Q1 {-}

Answer the following using the definition of conditional probability.

**1.1.** In a deck of $52$ cards, one card is drawn at random. Let $A$ be the event that the card is a heart, and $B$ the event that the card is red. What is the probability that the card is a heart, given that it is red?

**1.2.** In a university class, $60\%$ of students are left-handed and $25\%$ of left-handed students play the piano. What is the probability that a randomly chosen student plays the piano, given that they are left-handed?

**1.3.** In the workforce of Cantor's Confectionery, $30\%$ of employees speak French and $15\%$ of employees take both French and Spanish. Let $A$ be the event that an employee takes Spanish, and $B$ the event that the employee takes French. What is the probability that an employee takes Spanish, given that they take French?

**1.4.** The table below shows survey results from a school about whether students bring a packed lunch and whether they are sixteen:

|                       | Sixteen | Not sixteen | Total |
|--------|------|------|------|
| **Packed lunch**          | 0.25    | 0.15         | 0.40   |
| **No packed lunch**       | 0.35    | 0.25         | 0.60   |
| **Total**                 | 0.60    | 0.40         | 1.00   |

Let $A$ be the event that a student is sixteen, and $B$ the event that they bring a packed lunch. What is the probability that the student is sixteen, given they bring a packed lunch?

## Q2 {-}

Use the multiplication rule to solve the following problems.

**2.1.** A Cantor's Confectionery Lagrange Lucky Dip bag contains $3$ green sweets and $2$ yellow sweets. Two sweets are picked one after the other without replacement. What is the probability that both sweets are green?

**2.2.** In the Cantor's Confectionery factory, the probability that a box of Bayes Biscuits passes inspection is $0.9$, and the probability it passes a second inspection given it passed the first is $0.95$. What is the probability that a box of Bayes Biscuits passes both inspections?

**2.3.** A coin is flipped, and then a die is rolled. The probability of getting heads on the coin is $1/2$, and the probability of rolling a $6$ on the die is $1/6$. What is the probability of getting heads and rolling a $6$?

**2.4.** In a survey of the general populace, $70\%$ of people like tea and $60\%$ of tea-drinkers also like coffee. What is the probability that a randomly chosen person likes both tea and coffee?

## Q3 {-}

Decide whether the following events are independent.

**3.1.** In a study, $\mathbb{P}(A) = 0.4$, $\mathbb{P}(B) = 0.3$, and $\mathbb{P}(A \cap B) = 0.12$. Are $A$ and $B$ independent? Justify your answer.

**3.2.** Suppose $\mathbb{P}(A) = 0.3$ and $\mathbb{P}(A \mid B) = 0.3$. Are $A$ and $B$ independent? Justify your answer.

**3.3.** Suppose $\mathbb{P}(A) = 0.5$, $\mathbb{P}(B) = 0.4$, and $\mathbb{P}(A \cap B) = 0.1$. Are $A$ and $B$ independent? Justify your answer.

**3.4.** Suppose $\mathbb{P}(A) = 0.6$ and $\mathbb{P}(A \mid B) = 0.2$. Are $A$ and $B$ independent? Justify your answer.
