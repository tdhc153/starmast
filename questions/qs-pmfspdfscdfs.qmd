*Before attempting these questions it is highly recommended that you read [Guide: PMFs, PDFs, and CDFs].*

## Q1 {-}

For each of the scenarios below, determine if the given distribution is a valid PMF and answer the following questions.

1.1

Let $X$ be the random variable representing the result of rolling a biased four sided-die. The PMF of $X$ is given by:

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
$$p(x)$$
:::

| $x$      | $1$               | $2$              | $3$              | $4$              |
|--------|----|----|----|----|
| $P(X=x)$ | $\dfrac{1}{10}$ | $\dfrac{1}{5}$ | $\dfrac{1}{2}$ | $\dfrac{1}{5}$ |

What is the probability of $X = 4$?

1.2

A discrete random variable $X$ has five possible outcomes $1, 2, 3, 4,$ or $5$, and the PMF is given by:

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
$$p(x)$$
:::

| $x$      | $1$    | $2$    | $3$    | $4$   | $5$   |
|--------|----|----|----|----|----|
| $P(X=x)$ | $0.25$ | $0.35$ | $0.05$ | $0.2$ | $0.1$ |

What is the probability of $X = 3$ or $X = 4$?

1.3

A coin is tossed, where the probability of tails is $70%$ and heads is $30%$. Let $X$ represent the result of the coin toss. Complete the table below:

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
$$p(x)$$
:::

| $x$      | Heads | Tails |
|--------|----|----|
| $P(X=x)$ |       |       |

1.4

A discrete random variable $X$ has the possible outcomes $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,$ or  $7$, with the following PMF:

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
$$p(x)$$
:::

| $x$      | $1$   | $2$    | $3$ | $4$   | $5$    | $6$    | $7$    |
|--------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| $P(X=x)$ | $0.1$ | $0.05$ | $0.05$ | $0.3$ | $0.25$ | $0.75$ | $0.35$ |

Is this a valid PMF? Why or why not?

1.5

A bag contains $5$ red, $3$ blue, and $2$ green sweets from a sweet shop. Let $X$ represent the color of a randomly picked sweet:

a.  What is the probability of picking a blue sweet?
b.  Construct the PMF for this scenario by completing the table:

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
$$p(x)$$
:::

| $x$      | Red | Blue | Green |
|--------|----|----|----|
| $P(X=x)$ |     |      |       |

1.6

The PMF for a random variable $X$ is given as:

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
$$p(x)$$
:::

| $x$      | 1   | 2    | 3    | 4    |
|--------|----|----|----|----|
| $P(X=x)$ | $p$ | $2p$ | $3p$ | $4p$ |

a.  For what value of $p$ is this a valid PMF?

b.  For this value of $p$, what is the probability of $X = 3$?

## Q2 {-}

For each of the scenarios below, determine if the given distribution is a valid PDF and answer the following questions.

2.1

Let $X$ be a continuous random variable on the interval $[0, 2]$ with the PDF:
$$f(x) =\begin{cases} \dfrac{1}{2} & \text{if } 0 \leq x \leq 2 \\0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

What is the probability that $X$ lies between 1 and 2?

2.2

Let $X$ be a continuous random variable with the PDF:
$$f(x) = \begin{cases} 2x & \text{if } 0 \leq x \leq 1, \\ 0 & \text{otherwise}.\end{cases}$$

a.  What is the probability that $X$ lies between 0.5 and 1?

b.  What is $P(0.25 > X > 0.75)$?

2.3

Let $X$ be a continuous random variable uniformly distributed between 3 and 7. The PDF is:

$$ f(x) =\begin{cases}\dfrac{1}{4} & \text{if } 3 \leq x \leq 7 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise}\end{cases}$$

What is the probability that $X$ lies between 3 and 6?

2.4

The PDF of a random variable $X$ is given by:

$$ f(x) =\begin{cases}\dfrac{1}{9} & \text{if } 1 \leq x \leq 4 \\\dfrac{1}{4} & \text{if } 5 \leq x \leq 7 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise}\end{cases}$$

Is this a valid PDF? Why or why not?

2.5

Consider the PDF:

$$
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
k x^2 & \text{if } 0 \leq x \leq 1 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

a.  For what value of $k$ is this a valid PDF?

b.  For this value of $k$, what is the $P(0.2 \leq x \leq 0.3)$?

2.6

The PDF of $X$ is given by:

$$
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
4x & \text{if } 0 \leq x < 0.5, \\
4 - 4x & \text{if } 0.5 \leq x < 0.75, \\
0.5 & \text{if } 0.75 \leq x \leq 1, \\
0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$

Is this a valid PDF? Why or why not?

|--------|----|----|----|----|

|--------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| $P(X=x)$ | $0.1$ | $0.2$ | $0.5$ | $0.4$ | $0.8$ | $1$   |

Is this a valid CDF? Why or why not?
