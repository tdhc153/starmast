*Before attempting these questions, it is highly recommended that you read [Guide: Introduction to linear regression](../studyguides/linearregression.qmd).*

## Q1 {-}

This question is about the regression line of a simple linear regression model.

**1.1** What does the regression parameter $\alpha$ represent?

**1.2** What does the regression parameter $\beta$ represent?


## Q2 {-}

This question is about the method of least squares estimation.

**2.1** What is a 'residual'?

**2.2** What is the purpose of least squares estimation?

## Q3 {-}

<!-- Here is the code used to generate the following questions and their corresponding answers. -->
<!-- ``` {r} -->
<!-- confectionery = data.frame(customers=c(43,54,65,42,68,49, 63,57,71,47,75,67),sweets=c(188,197,215,217,233,244, 254,256,274,286,291,300)) -->
<!-- model=lm(sweets~customers,data=confectionery) -->
<!-- summary(model) -->
<!-- # par(mfrow=c(2,2)) -->
<!-- plot(model) -->

<!-- confint(model,level=0.95) -->
<!-- confint(model,level=0.9) -->
<!-- # predict.lm(model,interval='confidence') -->

This question uses the following set of data, which is from a sweet shop called Cantor's Confectionery.

Cantor's Confectionery recorded the number of customers and the number of sweets sold on a random sample of 10 days in a particular year:

| Number of customers | Number of sweets sold |
|:--------------------|:----------------------|
| 43                  | 188                   |
| 54                  | 197                   |
| 65                  | 215                   |
| 42                  | 217                   |
| 68                  | 233                   |
| 49                  | 244                   |
| 63                  | 254                   |
| 57                  | 256                   |
| 71                  | 274                   |
| 47                  | 286                   |
| 75                  | 291                   |
| 67                  | 300                   |

**3.1.** Estimate the value of $\alpha$ using least squares estimation.

**3.2.** Estimate the value of $\beta$ using least squares estimation.

**3.3.** Using your answers to Q3.1., and Q3.2., write the linear regression model.

<!-- ## Q2 {.unnumbered} -->

<!-- The following graphs correspond to the data in Q1. Use them to answer the following questions. -->

<!-- **2.1.** Is the assumption of independence appropriate? -->

<!-- **2.2.** Is the assumption of normality appropriate? -->

<!-- **2.3.** Is the assumption of linearity appropriate? -->

<!-- **2.4.** Is the assumption of constant variance appropriate? -->

<!-- **2.5.** Can the data be modelled using normal linear regression? -->

<!-- ## Q3 {.unnumbered} -->

<!-- These questions ask you to find confidence intervals for the data in Q1. -->

<!-- **3.1.** Calculate a 95% confidence interval for $\hat{\alpha}$. -->

<!-- **3.2.** Calculate a 95% confidence interval for $\hat{\beta}$. -->

<!-- **3.3.** Calculate a 90% confidence interval for $\hat{\alpha}$. -->

<!-- **3.4.** Calculate a 90% confidence interval for $\hat{\beta}$. -->
