*These are the answers to [Questions: Introduction to confidence intervals](../questions/qs-confidenceintervals.qmd).*

**Please attempt the questions before reading these answers.**

## Q1

1.1. $95\%$ or $0.95$

1.2. $90\%$ or $0.90$

1.3. $99\%$ or $0.99$

## Q2

2.1. $Z_\frac{\alpha}{2} = 1.960$

2.2. $Z_\frac{\alpha}{2} = 1.645$

2.3. $Z_\frac{\alpha}{2} = 2.576$

## Q3

3.1. $n = 178$

3.2. $\bar{x} = 14$

3.3. $\sigma = 0.75$

3.4. $\alpha = 0.1$

3.5. $Z_\frac{\alpha}{2} = 2.576$

## Q4

4.1.

From **Q3**: $\bar{x} = 14, Z_\frac{\alpha}{2} = 2.576, \sigma = 0.75, n = 178$

$= 14 \pm 2.576(\frac{0.75}{178})$

$= [13.989, 14.011]$

4.2. If Cantor's Confectionery were to repeat the study several times, they would expect the true mean of the weights of their chocolate swirls to lie between $[13.989, 14.011]$, with $90\%$ confidence.
