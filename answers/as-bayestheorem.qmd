*These are the answers to [Questions: Law of total probability and Bayes’ theorem](../questions/qs-bayestheorem.qmd).*

**Please attempt the questions before reading these answers.**

## Q1 {-}

#### 1.1. {-}

You know:

* $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Ward A}) = 0.4$  
* $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Recover} \mid \textsf{Ward A}) = 0.8$  
* $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Ward B}) = 0.6$  
* $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Recover} \mid \textsf{Ward B}) = 0.6$

Using the law of total probability:

$$
\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Recover}) = \left(\dfrac{4}{10}\right)\left(\dfrac{8}{10}\right) + \left(\dfrac{6}{10}\right) \left(\dfrac{6}{10}\right) = 0.32 + 0.36 = 0.68
$$

So the probability that a randomly chosen patient recovers is $0.68$.

#### 1.2. {-}
You know:

* $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Veg}) = 0.5$, $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Finish} \mid \textsf{Veg}) = 0.9$  
* $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Chicken}) = 0.3$, $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Finish} \mid \textsf{Chicken}) = 0.7$
* $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Fish}) = 0.2$, $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Finish} \mid \textsf{Fish}) = 0.8$

Using the law of total probability:

$$
\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Finish}) = (0.5)(0.9) + (0.3)(0.7) + (0.2)(0.8) = 0.45 + 0.21 + 0.16 = 0.82
$$

So the probability that a randomly chosen student finishes their lunch is $0.82$.

#### 1.3. {-}
You know:

* $\mathbb{P}(F_1) = 0.2$, $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Defective} \mid F_1) = 0.05$  
* $\mathbb{P}(F_2) = 0.3$, $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Defective} \mid F_2) = 0.02$  
* $\mathbb{P}(F_3) = 0.5$, $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Defective} \mid F_3) = 0.01$

Using the law of total probability:

$$
\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Defective}) = (0.2)(0.05) + (0.3)(0.02) + (0.5)(0.01) = 0.01 + 0.006 + 0.005 = 0.021
$$

So the probability that a randomly selected product is defective is $0.021$.

#### 1.4. {-}
You know:

* $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Home}) = 0.5$, $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Complete} \mid \textsf{Home}) = 0.7$  
* $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Library}) = 0.3$, $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Complete} \mid \textsf{Library}) = 0.9$  
* $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Café}) = 0.2$, $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Complete} \mid \textsf{Café}) = 0.6$

Using the law of total probability:

$$
\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Complete}) = (0.5)(0.7) + (0.3)(0.9) + (0.2)(0.6) = 0.35 + 0.27 + 0.12 = 0.74
$$

So the probability that the student completes their homework is $0.74$.

## Q2 {-}

#### 2.1. {-}

You know:

* $\mathbb{P}(D) = 0.02$  
* $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Pos} \mid D) = 0.95$  
* $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Pos} \mid \neg D) = 0.1$ (where $\neg D$ means the person does not have the disease) 
* $\mathbb{P}(\neg D) = 0.98$  

Using the law of total probability:

$$
\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Pos}) = (0.02)(0.95) + (0.98)(0.1) = 0.019 + 0.098 = 0.117
$$

Now applying Bayes’ theorem:

$$
\mathbb{P}(D \mid \textsf{Pos}) = \dfrac{(0.95)(0.02)}{0.117} \approx 0.162
$$

So the probability that the person has the disease, given that they test positive, is approximately $0.162$. Not a very good test!

#### 2.2. {-}

You know:

* $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Rain}) = 0.4$  
* $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Dry}) = 0.6$  
* $\mathbb{P}(F \mid \textsf{Rain}) = 0.8$  
* $\mathbb{P}(F \mid \textsf{Dry}) = 0.1$  

Using the law of total probability:

$$
\mathbb{P}(F) = (0.4)(0.8) + (0.6)(0.1) = 0.32 + 0.06 = 0.38
$$

Then applying Bayes' theorem gives:

$$
\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Rain} \mid F) = \dfrac{(0.8)(0.4)}{0.38} \approx 0.842
$$

So the probability that it actually rains in St Andrews, given that the forecast predicts rain, is approximately $0.842$.

#### 2.3. {-}

You know:

* $\mathbb{P}(A) = 0.7$  
* $\mathbb{P}(B) = 0.3$  
* $\mathbb{P}(F \mid A) = 0.02$  
* $\mathbb{P}(F \mid B) = 0.05$

Using the law of total probability:

$$
\mathbb{P}(F) = (0.7)(0.02) + (0.3)(0.05) = 0.014 + 0.015 = 0.029
$$

Then applying Bayes' theorem gives:

$$
\mathbb{P}(B \mid F) = \dfrac{(0.05)(0.3)}{0.029} \approx 0.517
$$

So the probability that the broken biscuit came from Machine B, given that it is broken, is approximately $0.517$.

#### 2.4. {-}

You know:

* $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Red}) = 0.4$  
* $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Blue}) = 0.6$  
* $\mathbb{P}(W \mid \textsf{Red}) = 0.3$  
* $\mathbb{P}(W \mid \textsf{Blue}) = 0.7$

Using the law of total probability:

$$
\mathbb{P}(W) = (0.4)(0.3) + (0.6)(0.7) = 0.12 + 0.42 = 0.54
$$

Then applying Bayes' theorem gives:

$$
\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Red} \mid W) = \dfrac{(0.3)(0.4)}{0.54} \approx 0.222
$$
So the probability that the sweet is red, given that it has a wrapper, is approximately $0.222$.
