# Defining hypotheses

1. $H_0: \mu=350$ $H_1: \mu<350$

2. $H_0: p=0.1$ $H_1: p>0.1$

3. $H_0: \mu_a=\mu_b$ $H_1: \mu_a\neq\mu_b$

4. $H_0: \mu_r=\mu_x$ $H_1: \mu_r>\mu_x$

# Significance levels

5. $\alpha=0.15$

6. $\alpha=0.01$

# Test selection

7. Paired $t$-test

# Critical values and conclusions

8. I reject $H_0$ as the test statistic of $3.12$ is greater than the critical value of $2.58$. Therefore there is significant evidence to suggest the average daily sales of Boole Bars differ from 150.

9. I reject $H_0$ as the test statistic of $2.01$ is greater than the critical value of $1.645$. Therefore there is significant evidence to suggest the proportion of customers who buy Lagrangian Lollipops exceeds $40\%$.

10. I do not reject $H_0$ as the test statistic of $2.102$ is between the critical values of $2.306$ and $-2.306$. Therefore there is no significant evidence to suggest there is a difference in sweetness scores between the two recipes.
