*These are the answers to [Questions: Conditional probability](../questions/conditionalprobability.qmd).*

**Please attempt the questions before reading these answers.**

## Q1 {-}

#### 1.1. {-}

* $\mathbb{P}(A) = \dfrac{13}{52}$ (hearts)  
* $\mathbb{P}(B) = \dfrac{26}{52}$ (red cards)  
* $\mathbb{P}(A \cap B) = \dfrac{13}{52}$ (red hearts)

Using the definition of conditional probability:
$$
\mathbb{P}(A \mid B) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(A \cap B)}{\mathbb{P}(B)} = \frac{13/52}{26/52} = \frac{1}{2}
$$
So the probability that the card is a heart, given that it is red, is $1/2$.

#### 1.2. {-}

You are given:

* $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{Piano} \mid \textsf{Left-handed}) = 0.25$

So the probability that a randomly chosen student plays the piano, given that they are left-handed, is $0.25$.

#### 1.3. {-}

* $\mathbb{P}(A \cap B) = 0.15$  
* $\mathbb{P}(B) = 0.30$

Using the definition of conditional probability:
$$
\mathbb{P}(A \mid B) = \dfrac{\mathbb{P}(A \cap B)}{\mathbb{P}(B)} = \dfrac{0.15}{0.30} = 0.5
$$

So the probability that an employee takes Spanish, given that they take French, is $0.5$.

#### 1.4. {-}

* $\mathbb{P}(A \cap B) = 0.25$  
* $\mathbb{P}(B) = 0.40$

Using the definition of conditional probability:
$$
\mathbb{P}(A \mid B) = \dfrac{0.25}{0.40} = \dfrac{5}{8} = 0.625
$$

So the probability that the student is sixteen, given they bring a packed lunch, is $0.625$.

## Q2 {-}

#### 2.1. {-}

* $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{first green}) = \dfrac{3}{5}$  
* $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{second green} \mid \textsf{first green}) = \dfrac{2}{4}$

Using the multiplication rule:
$$
\mathbb{P}(\textsf{both green}) = \left(\dfrac{3}{5}\right)\left(\dfrac{2}{4}\right) = \dfrac{6}{20} = 0.3
$$

So the probability that both sweets are green is $0.3$.

#### 2.2. {-}

* $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{first pass}) = 0.9$  
* $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{second pass} \mid \textsf{first pass}) = 0.95$

Using the multiplication rule:
$$
\mathbb{P}(\textsf{both pass}) = (0.9)(0.95) = 0.855
$$

So the probability that a box of Bayes Biscuits passes both inspections is $0.855$.

#### 2.3. {-}

These are independent events, so

* $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{heads}) = 0.5$  
* $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{roll a 6}) = \dfrac{1}{6}$

Using the multiplication rule:
$$
\mathbb{P}(\textsf{heads and 6}) = (0.5)\left(\dfrac{1}{6}\right) = \dfrac{1}{12}
$$

So the probability of getting heads and rolling a $6$ is $\dfrac{1}{12}$.

#### 2.4. {-}

* $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{likes tea}) = 0.7$  
* $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{likes coffee} \mid \textsf{likes tea}) = 0.6$

Using the multiplication rule:
$$
\mathbb{P}(\textsf{likes both}) = (0.7)(0.6) = 0.42
$$

So the probability that a random person likes both tea and coffee is $0.42$.

## Q3 {-}

#### 3.1. {-}

Given: $\mathbb{P}(A) = 0.4$, $\mathbb{P}(B) = 0.5$, $\mathbb{P}(A \cap B) = 0.2$

Check:

$$
\mathbb{P}(A)\mathbb{P}(B) = (0.4)(0.5) = 0.2 
$$

Since $\mathbb{P}(A \cap B) = \mathbb{P}(A)\mathbb{P}(B)$, the events are **independent**.

#### 3.2. {-}

Given: $\mathbb{P}(A) = 0.3$, $\mathbb{P}(A \mid B) = 0.3$

Since $\mathbb{P}(A \mid B) = \mathbb{P}(A)$, events are **independent**.

#### 3.3. {-}

Given: $\mathbb{P}(A) = 0.5$, $\mathbb{P}(B) = 0.4$, $\mathbb{P}(A \cap B) = 0.1$

Check:

$$
\mathbb{P}(A)\mathbb{P}(B) = (0.5)(0.4) = 0.2 \neq 0.1 = \mathbb{P}(A \cap B)
$$

Since $\mathbb{P}(A \cap B) \neq \mathbb{P}(A)\mathbb{P}(B)$, the events are **dependent**.

#### 3.4. {-}

Given: $\mathbb{P}(A) = 0.6$, $\mathbb{P}(A \mid B) = 0.2$

Since $\mathbb{P}(A \mid B) \neq \mathbb{P}(A)$, the events are **dependent**.
