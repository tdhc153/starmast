## Q2 {.unnumbered}

(Note: accept all simplified fractions, or probabilities represented in decimal and percentage forms)

**2.1.**

(a) $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{gummy bear}) = \frac{7}{12}$. Therefore, apply the complement rule to calculate the complement of $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{gummy bear})$, so $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{gummy bear}') = 1-\frac{7}{12}=\frac{5}{12}$.

(b) The probability of drawing a gummy ring the first time is $\frac{2}{12}$, and the probability of drawing a gummy ring the second time is also $\frac{2}{12}$. Therefore, $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{gummy ring and gummy ring})=(\frac{2}{12})(\frac{2}{12})=\frac{4}{144}=\frac{1}{36}$.

(c) The probability of drawing a gummy bear the first time is $\frac{7}{12}$, and the probability of drawing a gummy worm the second time is $\frac{3}{11}$. Therefore, $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{gummy bear then gummy worm})=(\frac{7}{12})(\frac{3}{11})=\frac{21}{132}=\frac{7}{44}$.

**2.2.** The probability of drawing a cola flavored jelly bean the first time is $\frac{10}{30}$, and the probability of drawing a strawberry flavored jelly bean the second time is $\frac{20}{38}$. Therefore, $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{soda and strawberry})=(\frac{10}{30})(\frac{20}{38})=\frac{200}{1140}=\frac{10}{57}$.

## Q3 {.unnumbered}

**3.1.** This is an example of experimental probability.

**3.2.** The total number of spins is 60, and it lands on white 17 times. Therefore, $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{white})=\frac{17}{60}$, so by the complement rule, $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{white}')=1-\frac{17}{60}=\frac{43}{60}$.

**3.3.** The spinner is unbiased (meaning the probability is uniform), so there are four possible colors that the spinner is equally likely to land on. Calculating the theoretical probability, $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{red})=\frac{1}{4}$.

**3.4.** As you spin the spinner more times, the experimental probabilities of each color will get closer to their theoretical probabilities.

## Q4 {.unnumbered}

**4.1.** The sample space is $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20\}$, which contains 20 possible outcomes. The subset of the sample space with a value above 12 is $\{13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20\}$, which contains 8 out of the 20 possible outcomes. Therefore, $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{success})=\frac{8}{20}=\frac{2}{5}$.

**4.2.** The possible outcomes of the 5-sided dice roll are $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$. Adding 3 to each number, the sample space becomes $\{(1+3),(2+3),(3+3),(4+3),(5+3)\}=\{4,5,6,7,8\}$. The sample space contains 5 possible outcomes, and the subset of the sample space that contains values 5 and above is $\{5,6,7,8\}$, which contains 4 out of 5 possible outcomes. Therefore, $\mathbb{P}(x\ge5)=\frac{4}{5}$ where $x$ points of damage are dealt to the dragon.

**4.3.** Here is the sample space represented as a table:

|       | 1     | 2     | 3     | 4     |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **1** | (1,1) | (1,2) | (1,3) | (1,4) |
| **2** | (2,1) | (2,2) | (2,3) | (2,4) |
| **3** | (3,1) | (3,2) | (3,3) | (3,4) |
| **4** | (4,1) | (4,2) | (4,3) | (4,4) |

For convenience purposes, all outcomes that do not contain a 4 are then marked with an asterisk (although any way of marking or counting these outcomes are acceptable):

|       | 1       | 2       | 3       | 4     |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| **1** | (1,1)\* | (1,2)\* | (1,3)\* | (1,4) |
| **2** | (2,1)\* | (2,2)\* | (2,3)\* | (2,4) |
| **3** | (3,1)\* | (3,2)\* | (3,3)\* | (3,4) |
| **4** | (4,1)   | (4,2)   | (4,3)   | (4,4) |

There are 16 total possible outcomes in the sample space, and there are 9 outcomes that do not contain a 4. Therefore, $\mathbb{P}(\textsf{failure})=\frac{9}{16}$.

**4.4.** Here is the sample space represented as a table:

|       | 1     | 2     | 3     | 4     |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **1** | (1,1) | (1,2) | (1,3) | (1,4) |
| **2** | (2,1) | (2,2) | (2,3) | (2,4) |
| **3** | (3,1) | (3,2) | (3,3) | (3,4) |
| **4** | (4,1) | (4,2) | (4,3) | (4,4) |
| **5** | (5,1) | (5,2) | (5,3) | (5,4) |
| **6** | (6,1) | (6,2) | (6,3) | (6,4) |
| **7** | (7,1) | (7,2) | (7,3) | (7,4) |
| **8** | (8,1) | (8,2) | (8,3) | (8,4) |
| **9** | (9,1) | (9,2) | (9,3) | (9,4) |

The results of the two dice rolls can then be added together:

|       | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |
|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **1** | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| **2** | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
| **3** | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   |
| **4** | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   |
| **5** | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   |
| **6** | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  |
| **7** | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  |
| **8** | 9   | 10  | 11  | 12  |
| **9** | 10  | 11  | 12  | 13  |

For convenience purposes, all outcomes with skill levels that are greater than 9 are then marked with an asterisk (although any way of marking or counting these outcomes are acceptable):

|       | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    |
|-------|------|------|------|------|
| **1** | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    |
| **2** | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    |
| **3** | 4    | 5    | 6    | 7    |
| **4** | 5    | 6    | 7    | 8    |
| **5** | 6    | 7    | 8    | 9    |
| **6** | 7    | 8    | 9    | 10\* |
| **7** | 8    | 9    | 10\* | 11\* |
| **8** | 9    | 10\* | 11\* | 12\* |
| **9** | 10\* | 11\* | 12\* | 13\* |

There are 36 total possible outcomes in the sample space, and there are 10 outcomes where the skill level exceeds 9 points. Therefore, $\mathbb{P}(x>9)=\frac{10}{36}=\frac{5}{18}$ where $x$ is the number of skill level points.
