*These are the answers to [Questions: Introduction to linear regression](../questions/qs-linearregression.qmd).*

**Please attempt the questions before reading these answers!**

## Q1 {-}

**1.1** The y-intercept of the regression line $\mathbb{E}(Y) = \alpha + \beta x$

**1.2** The gradient of the regression line $\mathbb{E}(Y) = \alpha + \beta x$


## Q2 {-}

**2.1** The difference between the observed value $y_i$ and the estimated value $\mathbb{E}(Y_{i})$. 

**2.2** It minimizes the squared sum of the residuals to find the optimal regression line for a sample of data.

## Q3 {-}

**3.1.**  $\hat{\alpha} = 146.6853$

**3.2.**  $\hat{\beta} = 1.7044$

**3.3.**  $\mathbb{E}(Y) = \alpha + \beta x = \hat{\alpha} + \hat{\beta} x = 146.6853 + 1.7044 x$

<!-- ## Q2 {-} -->

<!-- **2.1.** Yes, because the samples were taken from different days. -->

<!-- **2.2.** No, because the points stray from the dashed line in the Q-Q plot. -->

<!-- **2.3.** No, because the red line is quite curved. -->

<!-- **2.4.** Yes, because the red line in the scale-location line is mostly flat. -->

<!-- **2.5** No, because the above assumptions do not all hold. -->

<!-- ## Q3 {-} -->

<!-- **3.1.** A 95% confidence interval for $\hat{\alpha}$ is given by $\hat{\alpha} \pm t_{n-2; 1 - \frac{5}{2}} \sqrt{S^2 \left (\frac{1}{n} + \frac{\bar{x}^2}{SS_{XX}} \right)} = (29.1078018, 264.262820)$. -->

<!-- **3.2.** A 95% confidence interval for $\hat{\beta}$ is given by $\hat{\beta} \pm t_{n-2; 1 - \frac{5}{2}} \sqrt{S^2 \left (\frac{1}{n} + \frac{\bar{x}^2}{SS_{XX}} \right)} = (-0.2745477, 3.683325)$. -->

<!-- **3.3.** A 90% confidence interval for $\hat{\alpha}$ is given by $\hat{\alpha} \pm t_{n-2; 1 - \frac{10}{2}} \sqrt{S^2 \left (\frac{1}{n} + \frac{\bar{x}^2}{SS_{XX}} \right)} = (51.04285847, 242.327763)$. -->

<!-- **3.4.** A 90% confidence interval for $\hat{\beta}$ is given by $\hat{\beta} \pm t_{n-2; 1 - \frac{10}{2}} \sqrt{S^2 \left (\frac{1}{n} + \frac{\bar{x}^2}{SS_{XX}} \right)} = (0.09463917, 3.314138)$. -->
