Welcome to STARMAST, an online bank of accessible resources in mathematics (and statistics, eventually) made by University of St Andrews staff and students for any student of mathematics or statistics.

As of 14 April 2025, we have **22** study guides on **20** topics, with **22** question sheets, **22** answer sheets, **3** fact sheets and **4** proof sheets. All of our resources can be found in our [**full index**](fullindex.qmd).

The principles behind our approach to accessibility can be found in the [style guide for writers (clickable link)](styleguide.qmd). All of our resources are **free to use, and they always will be**, and you can **modify them for your own ends** (with some restrictions); [please see our licensing page for more (clickable link)](license.qmd).

## How to use {-}

Each topic has a [**study guide**](studyguidelist.qmd) which explains the key concepts behind the topic and contains many examples to help you understand the subject. Once you have read the guide thoroughly, there will be an opportunity for you to test your knowledge in real time using the **quick-check problems** at the end of each guide.

Once you have read the guide and have consolidated your knowledge in the quick-check problems, you can attempt the [**question sheet**](qalist.qmd) on that particular topic. [**Answer sheets**](qalist.qmd) are provided for every question sheet. 

Catalogues of important results or information are collected in [**fact sheets**](fslist.qmd). 
You may also be curious as to *why* results are true. If you would like to know more about where the maths in the guides comes from, then there is a [**proof sheet**](pslist.qmd) that provides more detail. 

Alongside the web version, *every* page on the on the site has both a printable pdf version and an accessible, downloadable and editable Microsoft Word document attached. You can find these versions on the right hand side of every page, underneath the document structure.

Some links are placeholders for guides left to be written. For a list of those guides whose existence is mentioned in current materials but do not currently exist, please see [Tom's to-do list](ttdl.qmd).

## How to contribute {-}

Here at STARMAST, we welcome **any** contributions from you, the user. Whether it is pointing out a typo in the middle of a guide, suggestions for future guides on certain topics, or even writing guides yourself, we want to hear from you.

You can leave feedback on any of our webpages, including all of our materials. This facility is provided by a comment box at the bottom of every page. Or you can email **tdhc (at) st-andrews (dot) ac (dot) uk** with *any* issues. 

In particular, if you would like to contribute, please email tdhc (at the address above), and see the [list of wanted topics](ttdl.qmd), the [style guide](styleguide.qmd), and the [readme file on the github repository](https://github.com/tdhc153/starmast).
