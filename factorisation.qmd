1. What is the discriminant of the quadratic equation $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$?

Answer: The discriminant $D$ is equal to `r fitb(5)`.

2. You are given the quadratic equation $4h^2 - h + 101 = 0$. Identify the variable, and the coefficients $a,b,c$. 

Answer: The variable is `r fitb("h")`, and the coefficients are $a=$ `r fitb(4)`, $b=$ `r fitb(-1)`, and $c=$ `r fitb(101)`.

3. You are given three statements below. Decide whether they are true or false.

(a) The quadratic equation $m^2 + 4m + 4 = 0$ has two distinct real roots. Answer: `r torf(FALSE)`.

(b) The quadratic equation $m^2 - 4m - 4 = 0$ has exactly one real root. Answer: `r torf(FALSE)`.

(c) The quadratic eqution $4m^2 + 4m + 4 = 0$ has no real roots. Answer: `r torf(TRUE)`.
