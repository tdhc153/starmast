This guide covers addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on complex numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlotte McCarthy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompleting the square\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgebra\n\n\nSolving equations\n\n\nKey skills\n\n\n\nCompleting the square is an important technique to learn for dealing with quadratic expressions in a variety of places. It can help you solve quadratic equations, accurately sketch graphs of conic sections, and is widely used in integral calculus.\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Coleman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to complex numbers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey skills\n\n\nAlgebra\n\n\nComplex numbers\n\n\n\nComplex numbers are an extremely important concept in mathematics, as you can express a solution to any algebraic equation using complex numbers. This guide introduces the idea of a complex number in the form \\(z = a + bi\\), as well as the concepts of real and imaginary parts, complex conjugates, and Argand diagrams.\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Coleman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to differentiation and the derivative\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculus\n\n\n\nThe idea of differentiation is everywhere in modern mathematics and in the sciences as it is related to the rate of change of an object or process. In this guide, the idea of differentiation and the derivative is introduced from first principles, its role in explaining the behaviour of functions is explained, and derivatives of common functions are introduced and used.\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Coleman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to logarithms\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey skills\n\n\nAlgebra\n\n\n\nUsing logarithms to help understand large numbers is a fundamental skill when working in mathematics. Understanding the laws of logarithms, working with the natural logarithm and learning how to change the base of a logarithm are key in mastering their functionality.\n\n\n\n\n\nRitwik Anand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to quadratic equations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgebra\n\n\nSolving equations\n\n\n\nSolving quadratic equations of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) is a core skill in mathematics. Identifying variables and coefficients of quadratic equations, as well as finding the discriminant \\(D = b^2 - 4ac\\), are essential steps in solving quadratic equations.\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Coleman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to radians\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometry\n\n\nTrigonometry\n\n\n\nRadians are an important concept to understand in mathematics. They are used instead of degrees in areas like calculus and trigonometry, and so becoming comfortable converting between radians and degrees is an important skill. This guide also explains how to find lengths of circular arcs and areas of circular sectors.\n\n\n\n\n\nIfan Howells-Baines, Mark Toner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to rearranging equations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey skills\n\n\nAlgebra\n\n\n\nBeing able to rearrange equations is a crucial skill in mathematics as it can help us to simplify problems and better understand the relationships between variables.

Understanding what this notation is, how it works, and how to manipulate them is a valuable skill to learn for use in almost any area of mathematics.\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Coleman, Ifan Howells-Baines, Mark Toner\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to solving simultaneous equations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgebra\n\n\nSolving equations\n\n\n\nSolving simultaneous equations is a crucial skill in algebra. Understanding this concept allows you to find the common solution to a set of two equations. This guide will introduce you to finding if a pair of simultaneous equations in two variables has a solution or not, and then demonstrate two ways of solving a pair of simultaneous equations — the substitution method and the elimination method.\n\n\n\n\n\nOllie Brooke\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to vectors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometry\n\n\nVectors\n\n\nLinear mathematics\n\n\n\nQuantities expressing both a magnitude and a direction are called vectors. Vectors are used in various disciplines and have a wide range of real-life applications.\n\n\n\n\n\nAkshat Srivastava\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaws of indices\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey skills\n\n\nAlgebra\n\n\n\nIn mathematics, a knowledge of indices is important for an understanding of algebraic processes. The laws of indices enable expressions involving powers to be manipulated more efficiently than writing them out in full.\n\n\n\n\n\nZheng Chen, Zoe Gemmell\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRationalizing the denominator\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlgebra\n\n\nKey skills\n\n\n\nRationalizing the denominator is a technique for simplifying fractions involving square roots in the denominator.

You will see this relationship more in the following section on arc length and sector area. Radians are denoted by the symbol rad, or sometimes by \\(^c\\) (although this is slightly older).\nRadians are exclusively used to describe angles in calculus; therefore if you want to study calculus in the future it is extremely important to understand how to convert between degrees and radians, and be comfortable using radians more generally.\nThis guide will firstly describe the relationship between radians and circles. Then it will describe the relationship between radians and degrees showing how to convert between them.

However, the following health warning applies:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nMost of the time, you can undo multiplication in an equation by division. The only time you are not able to do this is if you divide by \\(0\\); which is strictly forbidden in mathematics and carries a heavy punishment. The expression \\(0/0\\) is undefined and should not be written.\n\n\nThe example below uses division to ‘undo’ the multiplication in the equation in \\(x\\). As with Example 1, this example uses more detail than is necessary to illustrate the concepts involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\n\nGiven the equation \\(8x = 9\\), you can make \\(x\\) the subject by dividing both sides by \\(8\\) (which is not equal to \\(0\\)). Doing this gives\n\\[\\frac{8x}{8} = \\frac{9}{8}\\]\nThis can then be simplified. As \\(\\dfrac{8}{8}\\) is equal to 1, the expression simplifies to \\[1\\cdot x = \\frac{8}{9}\\]\nwhich, as \\(1\\cdot x = 1\\) for all numbers \\(x\\), can be simplified to\n\\[x = \\frac{8}{9}\\] and since \\(x\\) is on its own on the left-hand side, you are finished.\n\n\nSimilarly, you can undo division in an equation by using multiplication. Since no equation will ever be divided by \\(0\\) to begin with, you can always undo division.\nThis next example combines what you have learned so far.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\n\nHow do you make \\(x\\) the subject of the equation \\(\\dfrac{3}{4}x + a = 6\\)?\nIn fact, you have a little bit of flexibility in this question. One way you can do it is isolate a multiple of \\(x\\) on one side by subtracting by \\(a\\) first. Doing this gives \\[\\frac{3}{4}x = 6 - a\\] You know that you can undo the division of \\(x\\) by \\(4\\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \\(4\\). Here, that you have to multiply all of the right hand side by \\(4\\); this includes both terms \\(6\\) and \\(-a\\). This is an important step; as if you don’t do this, you are violating the golden rule in not treating both sides of the equation exactly the same! To make sure you do not fall into this trap, it can be useful to use brackets to ensure everything on the right-hand side is multiplied by \\(4\\). Anyway, the next step in the rearranging is \\[3x = 4(6-a)\\] Now, dividing both sides by \\(3\\) (making sure to divide everything on the right-hand side by \\(3\\)) gives \\[x = \\frac{4(6-a)}{3}\\] and you are done.\n\n\nThere are many ways to do this question. You could do the division by \\(3\\) first, then the subtraction by \\(a/3\\), then the multiplication by \\(4\\). Here, the order of operations doesn’t matter so much, but isolating a multiple of the chosen variable on one side is often the best way to go about rearranging equations.\nThis forms the basis of the general strategy for rearranging any equation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen rearranging an equation for a variable, try to get exactly one term involving that variable on one side of the equation; then do what you need to do to isolate that variable.\n\n\nIt is also worth restating:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen multiplying/dividing one side of an equation by a number \\(a\\), make sure to multiply/divide everything on that side of an equation by \\(a\\).\n\n\nThis is a common health warning in rearranging equations, as you will see throughout the rest of the guide."

    "text": "Powers and roots\n\nUndoing powers of \\(n\\) using \\(n\\)th roots\nHow would you undo a power such as \\(x^2 = 9\\), \\(y^3 = 64\\) or even \\(x^n = a\\) (where \\(n\\geq 2\\) is a whole number)?\nThe idea is to use roots. However, there are some considerations to be made when taking the \\(n\\)th root of an equation.\nTake the first of these examples, which is \\(x^2 = 9\\). Here, you are trying to rearrange for \\(x\\), where \\(x\\) is some number than when squared gives \\(9\\). You would immediately think that \\(x = 3\\), and you’d be right; but \\(x\\) could also be \\(-3\\). How do you account for this? The idea is to use the square root symbol \\(\\sqrt{\\;}\\), but \\(x = \\sqrt{9}\\) can’t be two solutions at once. To get around this, you could define the square root symbol to always mean the positive square root of a number, and write \\(\\pm\\) to mean ‘plus or minus’. Therefore, if \\(x^2=9\\), then \\(x = \\pm \\sqrt{9} = \\pm 3\\) to rearrange for \\(x\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe square root of a negative number is not a real number. If you want to rearrange an equation like \\(x^2 = -4\\) for \\(x\\), then you will need to use complex numbers. See [Guide: Introduction to complex numbers] for more.\nComplex numbers are not considered in the rest of this guide.\n\n\nSo, what about \\(y^3 = 64\\)? Here there is only one number that when cubed is equal to \\(64\\); this number is \\(4\\). This is because \\((-4)^3 = -64\\). So in fact, you are able to take the cube root \\(\\sqrt[3]{\\;}\\) of any number and not have to worry about signs; if \\(y^3 = 64\\) then \\(y = \\sqrt[3]{64} = 4\\). You can contrast this to the case of the square roots!\nNow, what about \\(x^n = a\\)? If \\(n\\) is even, then \\(x^n\\) must be a square number, and so must be positive. In addition, if \\(n\\) is even then \\((-x)^n = x^n\\), and so you must also take positive and negative roots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndoing powers using \\(n\\)th roots\n\n\n\nSuppose that \\(x^n = a\\).\n\nIf \\(n\\) is even and \\(a \\geq 0\\), then \\[x = \\pm\\sqrt[n]{a}\\] where \\(\\sqrt[n]{a}\\) is the positive \\(n\\)th root of \\(a\\).\nIf \\(n\\) is odd, then \\[x = \\sqrt[n]{a}\\] where \\(\\sqrt[n]{a}\\) is the \\(n\\)th root of \\(a\\).\n\n\n\nThankfully, the situation of undoing \\(n\\)th roots using powers of \\(n\\) is not as complex (no pun intended!). Since there is no ambiguity about the sign of an \\(n\\)th root, you can raise to the power of \\(n\\) to undo the root in any case:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndoing \\(n\\)th roots using powers of \\(n\\)\n\n\n\nSuppose that \\(\\sqrt[n]{x} = a\\). Then \\(x = a^n\\).\n\n\nWhen rearranging equations involving powers of \\(n\\) and \\(n\\)th roots, you should always aim to isolate your variable on one side before undoing the power of \\(n\\) or the \\(n\\)th root. This is because:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn general, \\[a^n + b^n \\neq (a+b)^n \\quad\\textsf{ and }\\quad\\sqrt[n]{a} + \\sqrt[n]{b} \\neq \\sqrt[n]{a+b}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\n\nYou are given the equation \\(2z = 4x^2 + 5y\\). To make \\(x\\) the subject of this equation, you should isolate \\(4x^2\\) on one side of the equation like so:\n\\[4x^2 = 5y − 2z\\] Now, to apply the square root, you need to have \\(x^2\\) on its own. So divide by \\(4\\) to get\n\\[x^2 = \\frac{5y-2z}{4}\\] Now you can then take the square root of both sides to get\n\\[x = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{5y − 2z}{4}}\\] and this is your answer.\n\n\nFor roots in equations, you can use inverse operation of taking the equation to a power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\n\nIf you want to make \\(x\\) the subject of the equation \\(\\displaystyle \\sqrt[5]{\\frac{x^3}{2}} = b-1\\), you need to undo the fifth root around \\(x^3/2\\). This can be done by raising both sides to the power of \\(5\\). Following the health warning above, you must remember to raise everything on the right hand side to the power of \\(5\\). Doing this gives \\[\\frac{x^3}{2} = (b-1)^5\\] You cannot take cube roots yet however, because of that \\(2\\). Multiplying \\(2\\) from both sides gives \\[x^3 = 2(b-1)^5.\\] Now you can cube root to get \\[x = \\sqrt[3]{2(b-1)^5}\\] and you are done.\n\n\nFinally, let’s return to the initial example at the start of the guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\n\nLet’s take \\[5x^3y^3 + \\frac{6z}{w^4} = 4abc^2\\] How do you rearrange for \\(x\\)?\nFirst of all, you need to isolate the term involving \\(x\\) on one side of the equation. You can subtract \\(6z/w^4\\) from both sides of the equation to get \\[5x^3y^3 = 4abc^2 - \\frac{6z}{w^4}\\] You now need to get a power of \\(x\\) on its own by dividing through by \\(5\\) and \\(y^3\\). You can either do these separately or together. So dividing both sides of the equation by \\(5y^3\\) gives \\[x^3 = \\frac{4abc^2}{5y^3} - \\frac{6z}{5w^4y^3}\\] Now, taking the cube root of both sides gives \\[x = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{4abc^2}{5y^3} - \\frac{6z}{5w^4y^3}}\\] and this is your answer."

Here’s an example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\n\nSay you want to represent \\(\\sin(\\frac{4\\pi}{3})\\) and \\(\\cos(\\frac{4\\pi}{3})\\) on your unit circle. You would start with an unlabelled unit circle, marking on a line \\(\\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\) radians from the positive \\(x\\)-axis. Now you want to make our triangle. In this case, you can draw a triangle where one side is the negative \\(x\\)-axis. Geometrically you can split the angle into the straight line and the excess which forms our triangle. That means our triangle ‘starts’ \\(\\pi\\) radians away from the \\(x\\)-axis. This means that the angle in our triangle will be \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\) radians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Construction of triangle as in Example 1.\n\n\n\nAs you are using the unit circle, the hypotenuse will be equal to one. Then, you can label the opposite and adjacent sides as shown on the diagram above. As you know that \\(\\sin(\\theta)=\\frac{\\textsf{opposite}}{\\textsf{hypotenuse}}\\) and \\(\\cos(\\theta)=\\frac{\\textsf{adjacent}}{\\textsf{hypotenuse}}\\), you can see that the \\(y\\)-axis will represent \\(\\sin(\\theta)\\) and the \\(x\\)-axis \\(\\cos(\\theta)\\).\nSee Figure 4 for a picture of this angle on the unit circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The unit circle, with a few angles labelled to show the triangles formed; including the angle from Example 1.\n\n\n\n\nSo from Example 1, the value of \\(\\sin(4\\pi/3)\\) and \\(\\cos(4\\pi/3)\\) are the \\(y\\)-axis and the \\(x\\)-axis respectively. Together with the discussion before Example 1, this leads to a new definition of the two trigonometric functions \\(\\sin\\) and \\(\\cos\\):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of sin, cos, tan in terms of the unit circle\n\n\n\nLet \\((x,y)\\) be a point on the unit circle centred at the origin \\((0,0)\\). Let \\(\\theta\\) be the angle defined by the positive \\(x\\)-axis and the line segment from centre to the point \\((x,y)\\). Define \\[\\cos(\\theta) = x \\qquad \\sin(\\theta) = y\\] and \\[\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{y}{x} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\cos(\\theta)}\\]\n\n\nThis definition extends the trigonometric functions to situations outside right-angled triangles; dramatically increasing their usability. The figure below details how the values of \\(\\cos(t), \\sin(t), \\tan(t)\\) change as the angle \\(t\\) changes.\n\n\n\n\n \nIn the unit circle, the angle \\(\\theta\\) ranges from \\(0\\) to \\(2\\pi\\).\nOver this range, the values of the co-ordinates \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) range from positive to negative. Therefore, the three main trigonometric functions \\(\\sin\\), \\(\\cos\\) and \\(\\tan\\) take different signs in different positions.\n\nIf \\(x &gt; 0\\) and \\(y &gt; 0\\) (so \\(0 &lt; \\theta &lt; \\pi/2\\)), then both \\(\\cos(\\theta) &gt; 0\\) and \\(\\sin(\\theta) &gt; 0\\), and therefore \\(\\tan\\theta &gt; 0\\).\nIf \\(x &lt; 0\\) and \\(y &gt; 0\\) (so \\(\\pi/2 &lt; \\theta &lt; \\pi\\)), then \\(\\cos(\\theta) &lt; 0\\) and \\(\\sin(\\theta) &gt; 0\\), and therefore \\(\\tan(\\theta) &lt; 0\\).\nIf \\(x &lt; 0\\) and \\(y &lt; 0\\) (so \\(\\pi &lt; \\theta &lt; 3\\pi/2\\)), then both \\(\\cos(\\theta) &lt; 0\\) and \\(\\sin(\\theta) &lt; 0\\), and therefore \\(\\tan(\\theta) &gt; 0\\).\nIf \\(x &gt; 0\\) and \\(y &lt; 0\\) (so \\(3\\pi/2 &lt; \\theta &lt; 2\\pi\\)), then \\(\\cos(\\theta) &gt; 0\\) and \\(\\sin(\\theta) &lt; 0\\), and therefore \\(\\tan(\\theta) &lt; 0\\).\n\nSee Figure 5 for a picture of this behaviour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: A graphical depiction of signs of trigonometric functions in each quadrant.\n\n\n\nThis analysis has missed out values of the three trigonometric functions on the axes. Here \\(\\theta=0\\) along the positive \\(x\\)-axis, \\(\\theta=\\pi/2\\) along the positive \\(y\\)-axis, \\(\\theta=\\pi\\) along the negative \\(x\\)-axis, and \\(\\theta=3\\pi/2\\) along the negative \\(y\\)-axis.\n\nIf \\(\\theta = 0\\), then \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 0\\). Therefore \\(\\cos(0) = 1/1 = 1\\) and \\(\\sin(0) = \\tfrac{0}{1} = 0\\) and so \\(\\tan(0) = \\sin(0)/\\cos(0) = 0/1 = 0\\).\nIf \\(\\theta = \\pi/2\\) (right angle of positive \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes) then \\(x = 0\\) and \\(y = 1\\). Therefore \\(\\cos(\\pi/2) = 0/1 = 0\\) and \\(\\sin(\\pi/2) = 1/1 = 1\\). In this case, \\(\\tan(\\pi/2)\\) is undefined as \\(\\cos(\\pi/2) = 0\\).\nIf \\(\\theta = \\pi\\) (straight line, angle of positive \\(x\\) and negative \\(x\\) axes) then \\(x = -1\\) and \\(y = 0\\). Therefore \\(\\cos(\\pi) = -1/1 = -1\\) and \\(\\sin(\\pi) = 0/1 = 0\\). In this case, \\(\\tan(\\pi) = \\sin(\\pi)/\\cos(\\pi) = 0/(-1) = 0\\).\nIf \\(\\theta = 3\\pi/2\\) (right angle of positive \\(x\\) and negative \\(y\\) axes) then \\(x = 0\\) and \\(y = -1\\). Therefore \\(\\cos \\left(3\\pi/2\\right) = 0/1 = 0\\) and \\(\\sin\\left(3\\pi/2\\right) = -1/1 = -1\\). In this case, \\(\\tan(3\\pi/2)\\) is undefined as \\(\\cos (3\\pi/2) = 0\\)."

Therefore \\[\\overrightarrow{OA} = \\overrightarrow{OB} - \\overrightarrow{AB}= \\begin{bmatrix}-5\\\\-2\\\\-4\\end{bmatrix} - \\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\1\\\\-6\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}-6\\\\-3\\\\2\\end{bmatrix}\\] and so the co-ordinates of \\(A\\) are \\((-6,-3,2)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 10\n\n\n\nIf \\(\\mathbf{u} = 4\\mathbf{i} + 3\\mathbf{j}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v} = -\\mathbf{i} + 2\\mathbf{j}\\), how can you express \\(7\\mathbf{i} + 19\\mathbf{j}\\) in terms of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\)?\nWhat you can do here is take the sum of scalar multiples of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) (known as a linear combination) and set this vector equal to \\(7\\mathbf{i} + 19 \\mathbf{j}\\). It is important that you take these two scalars to be potentially different, so give them different names like \\(\\lambda\\) (‘lambda’) and \\(\\mu\\) (‘mu’). So \\[7\\mathbf{i} + 19 \\mathbf{j} = \\lambda \\mathbf{u} + \\mu \\mathbf{v}\\] Since \\(\\mathbf{u} = 4\\mathbf{i} + 3\\mathbf{j}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v} = -\\mathbf{i} + 2\\mathbf{j}\\), this becomes \\[7\\mathbf{i} + 19 \\mathbf{j} = (4\\lambda \\mathbf{i} + 3\\lambda\\mathbf{j}) + (-\\mu\\mathbf{i} + 2\\mu\\mathbf{j})\\] These two vectors are equal if and only if their components are equal. Therefore, this gives two simultaneous equations \\[\\begin{align*}\n7 &= 4\\lambda - \\mu \\tag{\\textsf{$\\mathbf{i}$ component}}\\\\\n19 &= 3\\lambda + 2\\mu \\tag{\\textsf{$\\mathbf{j}$ component}}\n\\end{align*}\\] Solving these equations (see [Guide: Solving simultaneous equations] for more) gives \\(\\lambda = 3\\) and \\(\\mu = 5\\), and so \\[7\\mathbf{i} + 19\\mathbf{j} = 3\\mathbf{u} + 5\\mathbf{v}.\\]"

    "text": "Examples\nHere’s some examples of differentiation in action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n\nFind the derivative of the function \\(f(x) = \\dfrac{x^2}{2} + 1\\).\nHere, you can use the sum and scaling rules to differentiate this function. Using the sum rule, you can see that \\[\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(\\dfrac{x^2}{2} + 1\\right) = \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(\\dfrac{x^2}{2}\\right) + \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(1\\right)\\] Now, using the scaling rule on the first of these terms, you can get \\[\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(\\dfrac{x^2}{2}\\right) + \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(1\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(x^2\\right) + \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(1\\right)\\]\nNow you can use the derivatives of common functions. The function \\(x^2\\) is of the form \\(x^n\\), so the derivative of \\(x^2\\) is \\(2x^{2-1} = 2x^1 = 2x\\). The function \\(1\\) is a constant, so the derivative of \\(1\\) is \\(0\\). Putting these results in gives \\[\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(x^2\\right) + \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(1\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(2x) + 0\\] Simplifying gives the answer: \\(\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(\\dfrac{x^2}{2} + 1\\right) = x\\) and so the derivative of \\(f(x) = x^2/2 + 1\\) is equal to \\(f'(x) = x\\).\nYou can then say that this function \\(f(x) = x^2/2 + 1\\) is increasing if \\(x &gt; 0\\), decreasing if \\(x &lt; 0\\), and is stationary exactly when \\(x = 0\\).\n\n\nYou do not need to be so meticulous in your general practice when differentiating. You can differentiate functions without stating what rules you are using.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\n\nFind the derivative of the function \\(f(x) = 4e^{3x} - \\sqrt{x}\\).\nOf these two terms, \\(4e^{3x}\\) looks like a common function, but you have not seen how to differentiate \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) yet. In fact, this is another case of \\(x^n\\); in this case, \\(n = 1/2\\). (See Guide: Laws of indices for why this is.)\nYou can then rewrite the function as \\[f(x) = 4e^{3x} - x^{1/2}\\] which you can then apply your knowledge of differentiation to. Using the results above, the derivative of \\(4e^{3x}\\) is \\(4\\cdot3\\cdot e^{3x} = 12e^{3x}\\). The derivative of \\(x^{1/2}\\) is \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)x^{1/2 - 1} = \\dfrac{x^{-1/2}}{2}\\). Therefore, the derivative of \\(4e^{3x} - \\sqrt{x}\\) is \\[f'(x) = 12e^{3x} - \\frac{x^{-1/2}}{2}\\]\nYou could turn \\(x^{-1/2}\\) into \\(1/\\sqrt{x}\\); however, you may be asked to differentiate this function again (particularly if you are looking into behaviour of a function), and often it is best to leave the power as a real number rather than using the square root notation.\n\n\nAs a rule of thumb, you should always write an \\(n\\)th root using a fractional power instead. Here’s another example of where you should write a term involving a power of \\(x\\):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\n\nFind the derivative of the function \\(f(x) = \\dfrac{1}{x^4} + 4\\cos(x) - \\sin(4x)\\).\nAgain, the cosine and sine terms are manageable from the derivative above, it is only the \\(1/x^4\\) term that needs a little thought. In fact, this is yet another case of \\(x^n\\); this time when \\(n = - 4\\). (See Guide: Laws of indices for why this is.)\nYou can then rewrite the function as \\[f(x) = x^{-4} + 4\\sin(x) - \\cos(4x)\\] and use the familiar rules of differentiation above. Using the results above with \\(n = -4\\), the derivative of \\(x^{-4}\\) is \\(-4x^{-4-1} = -4x^{-5}\\). The derivative of \\(4\\sin(x)\\) is \\(4(\\cos(x)) = 4\\cos(x)\\). The derivative of \\(\\cos(4x)\\) is \\(-4\\sin(4x)\\). Taking care of your signs you can write the derivative of \\(\\dfrac{1}{x^4} + 4\\cos(x) - \\sin(4x)\\) as \\[f'(x) = -4x^{-5} + 4\\cos(x) - (-4\\sin(4x)) = -4x^{-5} + 4\\cos(x) + 4\\sin(4x).\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\n\nDetermine the behaviour of the function \\(f(x) = 2\\ln(3x) - x\\) when \\(x = 1\\).\nHere, you will first need to differentiate the function \\(f(x)\\) to find \\(f'(x)\\). Then, you will need to evaluate the derivative \\(f'(x)\\) when \\(x = 1\\) to see how the function behaves.\nUsing your rules of differentiation as you found above, you can say that the derivative of \\(2\\ln(3x)\\) is \\(2/x\\), and the derivative of \\(x\\) is \\(1\\). Therefore, the derivative of the function \\(f(x) = 2\\ln(3x) - x\\) is \\[f'(x) = \\frac{2}{x} - 1.\\] You can evaluate the derivative \\(f'(x)\\) at \\(x = 1\\) to get \\[f'(1) = \\frac{2}{1} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1\\] and so the derivative is positive at \\(x = 1\\). This implies that the function \\(f(x) = 2\\ln(3x) - x\\) is increasing at the point \\(x = 1\\).\nIt also means that the gradient of the tangent to the function \\(f(x)\\) at the point \\((1,2\\ln(3) - 1)\\) is \\(1\\). You can see this in the figure below."

So, \\[\\mathbf{c}=3\\mathbf{i}-4\\mathbf{j}+5\\mathbf{k}=\\begin{bmatrix}3\\\\-4\\\\5\\end{bmatrix}.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\n\nTo express the vector \\(\\displaystyle \\mathbf{d}=\\begin{bmatrix}-7\\\\0\\\\4\\end{bmatrix}\\) in terms of \\(\\mathbf{i},\\mathbf{j},\\mathbf{k}\\), you can reverse the process given above to write \\[\\mathbf{d}=\\begin{bmatrix}-7\\\\0\\\\4\\end{bmatrix}=(-7)\\mathbf{i}+0\\mathbf{j}+4\\mathbf{k} = -7\\mathbf{i} + 4\\mathbf{k}.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHow do you express the zero vector \\(\\mathbf{0}\\) in both of these vector notations? Here, the values of each of the components of the zero vector are \\(0\\), so \\[\\mathbf{0} = 0\\mathbf{i} + 0\\mathbf{j} + 0\\mathbf{k} = \\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\0\\\\0\\end{bmatrix}.\\]\nHow do you express the negative of a vector \\(\\mathbf{a} = x\\mathbf{i} + y\\mathbf{j} + z\\mathbf{k} = \\begin{bmatrix}x\\\\y\\\\z\\end{bmatrix}\\)? The negative of a vector is its reverse; so all of the components are multiplied by \\(-1\\). Therefore \\[-\\mathbf{a} = (-x)\\mathbf{i} + (-y)\\mathbf{j} + (-z)\\mathbf{k} = \\begin{bmatrix}-x\\\\-y\\\\-z\\end{bmatrix}.\\]\nFinally, when are two vectors in our notation equal? Let \\(\\mathbf{a} = a_1 \\mathbf{i} + a_2 \\mathbf{j} + a_3 \\mathbf{k}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b} = b_1 \\mathbf{i} + b_2 \\mathbf{j} + b_3 \\mathbf{k}\\). These two vectors are equal if and only if they have the same direction and the same magnitude; so all the components must match. That is, \\[\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{b}\\quad\\textsf{ if and only if }\\quad a_1 = b_1,\\, a_2 = b_2,\\, a_3 = b_3.\\]"

    "text": "Phase shift identities\nAs seen in Guide: Trigonometry (degrees), you can use the unit circle to add or subtract an angle to your \\(\\theta\\) and find yourself on another point of the unit circle.\nFor example, suppose that you were to shift the angle by \\(90^\\circ\\). Then the distance that was projected on the \\(x\\)-axis is now projected on the \\(y\\)-axis and vice versa. This would lead to a change between \\(\\sin(\\theta)\\) and \\(\\cos(\\theta)\\). These lead to the following properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase shift with \\(90^\\circ\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\sin(\\theta\\pm 90) = \\pm\\cos(\\theta) \\qquad  \\cos(\\theta\\pm90) = \\mp\\sin(\\theta)\\] \\[\\sin(90-\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta) \\qquad \\cos(90-\\theta) = \\sin(\\theta) \\]\n\n\nWhen you move \\(180^\\circ\\) you get to the opposite side of the unit circle. This would lead to a change of sign as you go on the same distance, on the other side of the axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase shift with \\(180^\\circ\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\sin(\\theta+180) = \\sin(\\theta-180) = -\\sin(\\theta) \\qquad \\cos(\\theta+180) = \\cos(\\theta-180) = -\\cos(\\theta)\\]\nand so \\[\\tan(\\theta+180) = \\tan(\\theta-180) = \\tan(\\theta)\\]\n\n\nWhen you move \\(360^\\circ\\) you get back to where you started. Therefore:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase shift with \\(360^\\circ\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\sin(\\theta+360) = \\sin(\\theta) \\qquad \\cos(\\theta+360) = \\cos(\\theta)\\]\n\n\nFollowing these two results, you can say that \\(\\sin\\) and \\(\\cos\\) are periodic with period \\(360^\\circ\\). In fact, for any whole number \\(k\\) (both positive and negative), you can say that \\[\\sin(\\theta+k\\cdot360^\\circ) = \\sin(\\theta) \\qquad \\cos(\\theta + k\\cdot360^\\circ) = \\cos(\\theta)\\]\nFor more on this, see guide on Guide: Multiple revolutions and negative angles. You can use these equations to work out more trigonometric values:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\n\nUsing the fact that \\(\\cos(60) = 1/2\\) and \\(\\sin(60) = sqrt{3}/2\\), you can work out the values of \\(\\cos(1500)\\) and \\(\\sin(-2820)\\). Here, you can write \\[1500 = 1440 + 60 = 4\\cdot 360 + 60\\] and so \\[\\cos\\left(1500\\right) = \\cos\\left(4\\cdot 360 + 60\\right) = \\cos\\left(60\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}.\\] Similarly \\[-2820 = -2880 + 60 = -8\\cdot 360 + 60\\] and so \\[\\sin\\left(-2820\\right) = \\sin\\left(-8\\cdot 360 + 60\\right) = \\sin\\left(60\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}.\\]"

Rearranging \\((y-3)^2 - 144 = 0\\) for \\(y\\) gives \\(y = 13 \\pm 12\\), so \\(y = 1\\) or \\(y = 25\\).\n3.3. You worked out in 1.3 that \\(x^2 + 8x + 20 = (x+4)^2 + 4\\). Using the fact that \\((\\pm 2i)^2 = -4\\) (see [Guide: Introduction to complex numbers]), rearranging \\((x+4)^2 + 4 = 0\\) for \\(y\\) gives \\(y = -4 \\pm 2i\\), so \\(y = -4 - 2i\\) or \\(y = -4 + 2i\\).\n3.4.

By the laws of vector addition, \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} = \\overrightarrow{AO} + \\overrightarrow{OB} = -\\overrightarrow{OA} + \\overrightarrow{OB}\\), where \\(\\overrightarrow{OA}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{OB}\\) are the respective coordinates of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) written in vector form.

Adding two lots of \\(S\\) together gives the following:\n\nTherefore, \\(2S\\) is \\(N\\) lots of \\((N+1)\\); you can write this as \\(2S = N(N+1)\\).

The laws of indices make it possible to alter expressions involving powers more quickly than if they were written out whole.\nThis guide will introduce six properties of indices: multiplication, division, brackets, powers of zero, negative indices and fractional indices.\nIndices are used in many areas of science as a way of representing growth. Economics, biology, demographics and many more fields rely on this sort of growth; chemicals, radioactive waste, and sound are all examples of decay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of an index\n\n\n\nThe index of a variable (or a constant) is a value that represents how many times a variable is multiplied by itself. Indices are also known as powers or exponents. It is represented in the form\n\\[ a^r =\\underbrace{a\\cdot a \\cdot a \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot a}_{r\\textsf{ times}}\\]\nHere, \\(a\\) is the base and \\(r\\) is the index. Indices are a shorthand way of writing multiplications of the same number.\nAs \\(a\\) multiplied by itself once is \\(a\\), it follows that anything to the power of one is equal to itself \\(a^1 = a\\) and \\(1\\) to the power of anything is \\(1\\); so \\(1^r=1\\) for all real numbers \\(r\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n\nSuppose you have \\[2·2·2·2·2\\] you can write this as ‘\\(2\\) to the power of \\(5\\)’ \\[2^5\\] So \\[2^5 = 2·2·2·2·2 = 32\\] In this example, \\(2\\) is the base and \\(5\\) is the index."

    "text": "Initial examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n\nSolve \\(x^{\\frac{1}{2}}=8\\).\nYou can start squaring both sides of the equation to get \\((x^{\\frac{1}{2}})^2 = 8^2\\). Using Law 3, \\((x^{1/2})^2 = x^{2/2} = x\\); so then you get the answer \\(x = 64\\). To check if the answer is correct, you can substitute \\(64\\) back into the equation: \\(64^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt[2]{64}=8\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\n\nSolve \\(x^{-2}=9\\).\nUsing Law 5, \\(x^{-2} = 9\\) can be re-expressed as \\(\\frac{1}{x^2} = 9\\). Multiplying both sides by \\(x^2\\) gives you \\(1=9x^2\\). Then dividing both sides by \\(9\\) gives you \\(\\frac{1}{9}=x^2\\). Remembering you can have positive and negative roots, you get \\(x= \\frac{1}{3}\\) or \\(x= -\\frac{1}{3}\\) as the two solutions to this equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\n\nSolve \\(3^{4x}=27^{5-x}\\).\nYou can notice here that the two sides of the equation have different bases; so you need to write these in the same base. As \\(27=3^3\\), the equation can be rewritten as: \\(3^{4x}=(3^3)^{5-x}\\). Then using Law 3, you can write \\(3^{4x}=3^{15-3x}\\). Since the bases of both sides are equal, you can say that \\(4x=15-3x\\). Rearranging gives \\(x= 15/7\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\n\nSolve \\(x^{\\frac{5}{3}} + 3x^{\\frac{2}{3}} = 10x^{-\\frac{1}{3}}\\).\nIf you look at all of the indices in the question, the denominator is \\(3\\) and that is a hint of what you need to multiply by. Multiply by \\(x^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\) on both sides of the equation; using Law 1, this gives \\[\\begin{align*}\nx^{\\frac{5}{3}}\\cdot x^{\\frac{1}{3}} + 3x^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\cdot x^{\\frac{1}{3}} &= 10x^{-\\frac{1}{3}}\\cdot x^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\\\\nx^{\\frac{6}{3}} + 3x^{\\frac{3}{3}} &= 10x^0\n\\end{align*}\\] Using Law 4, you can further simplify this expression to get \\(x^2 +3x = 10\\), and so \\(x^2+3x-10=0\\). This is a quadratic equation; factorizing this equation gives you \\((x+5)(x-2)=0\\), then you can get \\(x=-5\\) and \\(x=2\\) as the two possible solutions to this equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\n\nSolve \\(2^{x+1}\\cdot 3^x =72\\).\nHere, you will need to condense the left-hand side into a single base. Using Law 1, you can write that \\[2^{x+1}\\cdot 3^x = 2(2^x\\cdot 3^x) = 72.\\] Next, use Law 7 to combine \\(2^x\\) and \\(3^x\\) into a single base; \\[2(2^x\\cdot 3^x) = 2((2\\cdot 3)^x) = 2\\cdot 6^x = 72.\\] Therefore, \\(6^x = 36\\). Since \\(36 = 6^2\\), it follows that \\(x = 2\\). (Or indeed, you could have taken logarithms of both sides to base \\(6\\).)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\n\nSolve \\(\\sqrt{(6x)^3}=8\\sqrt{27}\\).\nFirst of all, you can use Law 7 to write \\((6x)^3 = 6^3\\cdot x^3\\). Using Law 10, you can then write the left hand side of this equation as \\[\\sqrt{(6x)^3} = \\sqrt{6^3\\cdot x^3} = \\sqrt{6^3}\\cdot \\sqrt{x^3}\\] You can now work on \\(\\sqrt{6^3}\\); using Law 7 and Law 10, you can write \\[\\sqrt{6^3} = \\sqrt{2^3\\cdot 3^3} = \\sqrt{8}\\cdot \\sqrt{27}.\\] Therefore, the initial equation becomes \\[\\sqrt{(6x)^3} = \\sqrt{8}\\cdot \\sqrt{27}\\cdot\\sqrt{x^3}=8\\sqrt{27}.\\] Dividing both sides by \\(\\sqrt{8}\\) (thereby using Laws 2 and 6) and cancelling the \\(\\sqrt{27}\\) gives \\[\\sqrt{x^3} = \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{8}} = \\frac{8^1}{8^{1/2}} = 8^{1/2} = \\sqrt{8}.\\] Squaring both sides to undo the square root gives \\(x^3 = 8\\), and so \\(x = 2\\)."

What you can do instead is use the laws of indices to get an expression of the form \\(a^x = b\\) and then take logarithms. Using Law 1, you can write that \\[6^x = 3^x\\cdot 3^1 = 3(3^x)\\] Dividing both sides by \\(3^x\\) and using Law 8 gives \\[\\left(\\frac{6^x}{3^x}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{6}{3}\\right)^x = 3\\] and so you are left with \\(2^x = 3\\).

Then, you can rewrite the equation given as \\((5^x)^2 + 7(5^x) - 30 = 0\\) using Law 3, which is the same as writing \\[y^2 +7y - 30 = 0.\\]\nRecognizing that this is a quadratic equation (see Guide: Introduction to quadratic equations for more), you can use the quadratic formula or otherwise to show that \\[y = -10 \\quad \\textsf{or} \\quad y = 3.\\]\nAs \\(y = 5^x\\), this means that \\(5^x = -10\\) or \\(5^x = 3\\). By taking the logarithm of both sides to base \\(5\\), you can show that \\[x = \\log_5(-10) \\quad \\textsf{or} \\quad x = \\log_5(3).\\] Remember from above that the logarithm of a negative number is not defined, so \\(x = \\log_5(3)\\) is the only viable solution.\n\n\nThe final example uses many of the laws of indices!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 10\n\n\n\nSolve \\(3^{3x} = 5^{x-4}\\).\nThis example is similar to Example 8, only with a few extra steps. Once again, as \\(3\\) is not a power of \\(5\\) or vice versa, the strategy is to write the equation in the form \\(a^x = b\\) and then take logarithms of both sides.\nFirst of all, use Law 1 to write \\(5^{x-4} = 5^x\\cdot 5^{-4}\\) and Law 3 to write \\(3^{3x} = (3^3)^x\\). Since \\(3^3 = 27\\), the equation becomes \\[27^x = 5^x\\cdot 5^{-4}\\] Dividing both sides by \\(5^x\\) gives \\[\\frac{27^x}{5^x} = 5^{-4}\\] Using Law 8 and Law 5, you can write \\[\\left(\\frac{27}{5}\\right)^x = \\frac{1}{5^4} = \\frac{1}{625}\\] Taking logarithms to base \\(27/5\\) on both sides gives \\(x = \\log_{27/5}(1/625)\\), which is your final answer."

You can also solve any equation \\(ax = b\\) for \\(x\\), with \\(a,b\\) non-zero real numbers.\nBut real numbers cannot do everything.

At the moment, the diagrams in study guides are static png files produced using TikZ, the inbuilt drawing package in LaTeX. While they look good, they cannot be parsed by screen readers and are liable to scaling issues when moving from computer to phone. Since the inception of the project, STARMAST has looked for better ways to represent mathematical diagrams and boost interactivity of the site.\nInteractive figures powered by Desmos’s development tools solve this issue and then some. We are now able to render complex mathematical ideas in a wholly new and improved way, providing a much wider pedagogical scope than before. In addition to this, these figures come with some accessibility concerns already accounted for – such as being able to display in Braille.\nWork is now being done to replace as many of the old png files in the existing guides as possible, certainly on the website version of the resources. The png files will still need to be maintained in the pdf and docx versions of the resources.\n\n\nVersion history\n\nv1.0 initial version written by tdhc 04/12/24."

    "text": "The aim of this project is to produce accessible online resources for any and all interested students in mathematics and statistics. There are two ways that accessibility can be defined in this context:\n\ntechnical accessibility: ensuring that the way that material is presented is accessible to any user. These include things like ability to screen-read, ability to zoom, correct colour contrasts, etc.\naccessibility of language: ensuring that the material itself is understandable by all who read it. This could include users with specific learning difficulties (such as dyslexia or attention deficit disorder) or low literacy skills, international readers where English is not their first language, or even younger people looking for more mathematical support.\n\nOf these, the fact that you are writing in a language that can output to both HTML and Word documents satisfy the somewhat more stringent technical accessibility requirements (such as screen reading, ability to zoom). In addition, the setup for this project (html settings, a LaTeX document class, docx setup) takes care of some other aesthetic changes such as margins, headings, and line-spacing.\nThe other requirements are up to the writer – you!\nBelow are some guidelines to follow when writing for STARMAST.\n\n\n\nWhen writing for students using these materials, it’s important to know that these students could be coming from any level of mathematical knowledge or any level of literal knowledge. In particular, your reader can have any level of confidence in their ability to do mathematics or statistics.\nThe way that you write can directly affect this confidence. Below are five main principles of writing materials for this project.\n\n\nTraditionally, mathematical writing has used the first-person plural ‘we’, intending to lead the reader on a journey through the material. This is all well and good if you assume that the reader is confident with the work; but what if they are not confident in their ability?\nIf introductory material is written in an exclusive manner, then a student with absolutely no confidence will struggle. Every student needs to feel included and inspired when reading about mathematics or statistics; so write inclusively and in the active voice.\nThe problem is that ‘we’ could be inclusive (including the reader) or exclusive (not including the reader). If this is married to concepts which are quite difficult, it can be quick to feel excluded; not part of the journey.

    "text": "The aim of this project is to produce accessible online resources for any and all interested students in mathematics and statistics. There are two ways that accessibility can be defined in this context:\n\ntechnical accessibility: ensuring that the way that material is presented is accessible to any user. These include things like ability to screen-read, ability to zoom, correct colour contrasts, etc.\naccessibility of language: ensuring that the material itself is understandable by all who read it. This could include users with specific learning difficulties (such as dyslexia or attention deficit disorder) or low literacy skills, international readers where English is not their first language, or even younger people looking for more mathematical support.\n\nOf these, the fact that you are writing in a language that can output to both HTML and Word documents satisfy the somewhat more stringent technical accessibility requirements (such as screen reading, ability to zoom). In addition, the setup for this project (html settings, a LaTeX document class, docx setup) takes care of some other aesthetic changes such as margins, headings, and line-spacing.\nThe other requirements are up to the writer – you!\nBelow are some guidelines to follow when writing for STARMAST."

    "text": "When writing for students using these materials, it’s important to know that these students could be coming from any level of mathematical knowledge or any level of literal knowledge. In particular, your reader can have any level of confidence in their ability to do mathematics or statistics.\nThe way that you write can directly affect this confidence. Below are five main principles of writing materials for this project.\n\n\nTraditionally, mathematical writing has used the first-person plural ‘we’, intending to lead the reader on a journey through the material. This is all well and good if you assume that the reader is confident with the work; but what if they are not confident in their ability?\nIf introductory material is written in an exclusive manner, then a student with absolutely no confidence will struggle. Every student needs to feel included and inspired when reading about mathematics or statistics; so write inclusively and in the active voice.\nThe problem is that ‘we’ could be inclusive (including the reader) or exclusive (not including the reader). If this is married to concepts which are quite difficult, it can be quick to feel excluded; not part of the journey. In addition, using ‘we’ can be passive – if you want your reader to do mathematics, saying ‘we see this’ and ‘we deduce that’ may create a false sense of security.\nTherefore, the writing for this project will use the second-person singular ‘you’, with an emphasis on the active voice.
