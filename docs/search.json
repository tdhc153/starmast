To succeed in stealing a jewel, you must roll a 20-sided die and get a number above 12. Represent the sample space of this in the form of a list, then calculate the probability of succeeding.\n4.2. You are attacking a dragon. This time, you have to roll a 5-sided die, then 3 points will be added to the result of your die roll. Adding this up will determine how much damage is done to the dragon. Represent the sample space of this in the form of a list, then calculate the probability that at least 5 points of damage is done to the dragon.\n4.3. You roll a 4-sided die twice to determine your success. If at least one of the rolls results in a 4, you will succeed in committing the action. Represent the sample space of this in the form of a table, then calculate the probability of failing the action.\n4.4. You roll a 9-sided die and a 4-sided die. The sum of these two dice rolls determines your skill level. Represent the sample space of this in the form of a table, then calculate the probability that your skill level will exceed 9 points.\n#| '!! shinylive warning !!': |\n#|   shinylive does not work in self-contained HTML documents.\n#|   Please set `embed-resources: false` in your metadata.\n#| standalone: true\n#| viewerHeight: 420\n\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(bslib)\n\n# Hard-coded hex color for the button (a nice teal color)\nBUTTON_COLOR &lt;- \"#3F6BB6\"\n\nui &lt;- page_fluid(\n  title = \"Dice roller with n sides\",\n  \n  card(\n    card_header(\"Dice roller with n sides\"),\n    card_body(\n      # Use a row layout for landscape orientation\n      layout_columns(\n        col_widths = c(4, 4, 4), # Equal width columns\n        \n        # Left column: Description and settings\n        card(\n          card_body(\n            div(\n              style = \"display: flex; flex-direction: column; height: 100%; justify-content: center;\",\n              p(\"Click the button to roll a die.\", style = \"font-size: 18px;\"),\n              br(),\n              div(\n                style = \"background-color: #f8f9fa; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px;\",\n                h5(\"Die Settings:\"),\n                numericInput(\"sides\", \"Number of sides:\", value = 6, min = 3, step = 1),\n                helpText(\"Enter a number 3 or greater\")\n              )\n            )\n          )\n        ),\n        \n        # Middle column: Dice display\n        card(\n          card_body(\n            div(\n              style = \"height: 100%; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;\",\n              div(\n                style = \"font-size: 120px; line-height: 1; width: 150px; height: 150px; \n                       margin: 0 auto; border: 2px solid #ccc; border-radius: 15px;\n                       display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;\",\n                textOutput(\"diceValue\")\n              )\n            )\n          )\n        ),\n        \n        # Right column: Button\n        card(\n          card_body(\n            div(\n              style = \"display: flex; height: 100%; align-items: center; justify-content: center;\",\n              actionButton(\"rollButton\", \"Roll Dice\", class = \"btn-lg\", \n                          style = paste0(\"background-color: \", BUTTON_COLOR, \"; color: white;\"))\n            )\n          )\n        )\n      )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n  \n  # Validate the sides input\n  sides &lt;- reactive({\n    sides_value &lt;- input$sides\n    \n    # Ensure it's a valid number (integer ≥ 3)\n    if (!is.numeric(sides_value) || sides_value &lt; 3 || sides_value != round(sides_value)) {\n      # Default to 6 if invalid\n      return(6)\n    }\n    \n    return(as.integer(sides_value))\n  })\n  \n  # Create a reactive value to store the current roll\n  diceValue &lt;- reactiveVal(1)\n  \n  # Initialize with a valid roll\n  observe({\n    # Update the initial value when the number of sides changes\n    current_sides &lt;- sides()\n    current_value &lt;- diceValue()\n    \n    # If current value is out of range for the new number of sides, reset it\n    if (current_value &gt; current_sides) {\n      diceValue(sample(1:current_sides, 1))\n    }\n  })\n  \n  # Update the dice value when the roll button is clicked\n  observeEvent(input$rollButton, {\n    current_sides &lt;- sides()\n    \n    # Rolling animation - this is a simplified version using invalidateLater\n    # to simulate the dice rolling\n    for(i in 1:5) {\n      invalidateLater(i * 100)\n    }\n    \n    # Final roll\n    diceValue(sample(1:current_sides, 1))\n  })\n  \n  # Display the current dice value\n  output$diceValue &lt;- renderText({\n    diceValue()\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the application \nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n\nAfter attempting the questions above, please click this link to find the answers."

Further reading will be illustrated where required.\nThe starting point of this proof sheet is the limit definition of the derivative of a function:\nTo find the derivative of a function \\(f(x)\\), replace the function \\(f\\) in the right-hand side of the above limit, and then evaluate the limit. Care has to be taken to remove the \\(h\\) in the denominator of the fraction, as you cannot evaluate the limit as \\(h\\) tends to \\(0\\) with it still there! (Remember, dividing by \\(0\\) can be extremely hazardous to your health.)\nFrom here, the proof sheet will start with the proof of the derivative of \\(x^2\\), which will then be expanded using the binomial theorem to find the derivative of \\(x^n\\). Then, the derivative of \\(e^x\\) is found. Finally, the derivatives of \\(\\sin(x)\\) and \\(\\cos(x)\\) are demonstrated."

    "text": "The aim of this project is to produce accessible online resources for any and all interested students in mathematics and statistics. There are two ways that accessibility can be defined in this context:\n\ntechnical accessibility: ensuring that the way that material is presented is accessible to any user. These include things like ability to screen-read, ability to zoom, correct colour contrasts, etc.\naccessibility of language: ensuring that the material itself is understandable by all who read it. This could include users with specific learning difficulties (such as dyslexia or attention deficit disorder) or low literacy skills, international readers where English is not their first language, or even younger people looking for more mathematical support.\n\nOf these, the fact that you are writing in a language that can output to both HTML and Word documents satisfy the somewhat more stringent technical accessibility requirements (such as screen reading, ability to zoom). In addition, the setup for this project (html settings, a LaTeX document class, docx setup) takes care of some other aesthetic changes such as margins, headings, and line-spacing.\nThe other requirements are up to the writer – you!\nBelow are some guidelines to follow when writing for STARMAST.\n\n\n\nWhen writing for students using these materials, it’s important to know that these students could be coming from any level of mathematical knowledge or any level of literal knowledge. In particular, your reader can have any level of confidence in their ability to do mathematics or statistics.\nThe way that you write can directly affect this confidence. Below are six main principles of writing materials for this project.\n\n\nTraditionally, mathematical writing has used the first-person plural ‘we’, intending to lead the reader on a journey through the material. This is all well and good if you assume that the reader is confident with the work; but what if they are not confident in their ability?\nIf introductory material is written in an exclusive manner, then a student with absolutely no confidence will struggle. Every student needs to feel included and inspired when reading about mathematics or statistics; so write inclusively and in the active voice.\nThe problem is that ‘we’ could be inclusive (including the reader) or exclusive (not including the reader). If this is married to concepts which are quite difficult, it can be quick to feel excluded; not part of the journey. In addition, using ‘we’ can be passive – if you want your reader to do mathematics, saying ‘we see this’ and ‘we deduce that’ may create a false sense of security.\nTherefore, the writing for this project will use the second-person singular ‘you’, with an emphasis on the active voice. Saying ‘you can do this’ rather than ‘we can see that’ helps to instill confidence in the reader, and actually shifts the focus to the reader doing mathematics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour experiences with mathematics are unique, and will not be generally applicable to all students reading your work. If you think that something is ‘easy’ or ‘obvious’, then good for you; but even mentioning this in your writing will crush the confidence of any student reading your work.\nSo nothing is easy. Not even things you learned in high school. Everyone has to start somewhere, and that somewhere might be here. A consequence of this is that nothing should be hard either; present your material objectively.\nBelow is a table of banned adjectives, which does not claim to be complete. You can change most of these into adverbs by adding ‘ly’ to the end; these adverbs are banned too.\n\nA list of banned words.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t use these. Ever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEasy\nObvious\nTrivial\nStraightforward\n\n\nSimple\nEffortless\nPainless\nNot hard\n\n\nFoolproof\nElementary\nBasic\nClear.\n\n\nRun-of-the-mill\nUnchallenging\nNo trouble\nJust\n\n\n\nPlease feel free to let tdhc know if you want to make any addition to the list.\n\n\n\nIf a difficult concept is explained behind jargon or symbols that the student has to look up while trying to understand, then that concept becomes far harder to master. Learning mathematics is hard enough without students trying to translate what is going on.\nHowever, at some point, students will need to be introduced to mathematical terminology. It is a language after all. It is too much to expect to eliminate mathematical or statistical terms entirely, so minimise jargon where you can, and provide references to terms if needed. This includes symbols including the therefore symbol, quantifier symbols, the implied sign, etc; these are often substituted in place for explanation, and learning resources without explanation aren’t good learning resources.\n\n\n\n\nWhich is easier to read or understand: ‘so’, or ‘whenceforth’? How about: ‘deduction’ or ‘working’?\nAgain, there may be significant linguistic barriers to understanding; barriers which should not be in place when trying to learn mathematics. Therefore, keep your writing as simple as possible, and avoiding Latin terms and idioms/proverbs.\nExceptions of course should be made for mathematical terms, which should be clearly defined.\n\n\n\nWhile it may be tempting to relate everything you write to your education (‘saw this in A-level/Higher’, ‘this was in MT2XXX’, ‘this is used in physics’), please avoid this in your general mathematical writing. So avoid context where possible.\nIn general, subject-specific examples are to be avoided. Remember that your reader could be of any background; so including (say) a physics problem may put readers off who have absolutely no knowledge of physics.\nThere are some exceptions; when motivating the subject at hand, you may want to say ‘this is used in X and Y and Z’. This is absolutely fine.\n\n\n\nThe idea of a stage magician conjures up illusory elements; of sleight-of-hand, of work behind the screen, of misdirection and mystery. This is the opposite of our stated mission to make mathematics and statistics accessible for everybody and as inclusive as possible.\nYou may have seen in your education the idea of quick ‘tricks’ to help with mathematics; things like the difference of two squares, or creative addition of 0/multiplication by 1. The trouble is that these steps can be hard to see or justify to a mathematician who is low on confidence.\nTherefore, there’s no such thing as a trick on this website. ‘Technique’ is a far better word for our purposes. Every time you feel the need to use a ‘trick’ that you learned, consider writing out the working in full."

However, the following health warning applies:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nMost of the time, you can undo multiplication in an equation by division. The only time you are not able to do this is if you divide by \\(0\\); which is strictly forbidden in mathematics and carries a heavy punishment. The expression \\(0/0\\) is undefined and should not be written.\n\n\nThe example below uses division to ‘undo’ the multiplication in the equation in \\(x\\). As with Example 1, this example uses more detail than is necessary to illustrate the concepts involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\n\nGiven the equation \\(8x = 9\\), you can make \\(x\\) the subject by dividing both sides by \\(8\\) (which is not equal to \\(0\\)). Doing this gives\n\\[\\frac{8x}{8} = \\frac{9}{8}\\]\nThis can then be simplified. As \\(\\dfrac{8}{8}\\) is equal to 1, the expression simplifies to \\[1\\cdot x = \\frac{8}{9}\\]\nwhich, as \\(1\\cdot x = 1\\) for all numbers \\(x\\), can be simplified to\n\\[x = \\frac{8}{9}\\] and since \\(x\\) is on its own on the left-hand side, you are finished.\n\n\nSimilarly, you can undo division in an equation by using multiplication. Since no equation will ever be divided by \\(0\\) to begin with, you can always undo division.\nThis next example combines what you have learned so far.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\n\nHow do you make \\(x\\) the subject of the equation \\(\\dfrac{3}{4}x + a = 6\\)?\nIn fact, you have a little bit of flexibility in this question. One way you can do it is isolate a multiple of \\(x\\) on one side by subtracting by \\(a\\) first. Doing this gives \\[\\frac{3}{4}x = 6 - a\\] You know that you can undo the division of \\(x\\) by \\(4\\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \\(4\\). Here, that you have to multiply all of the right hand side by \\(4\\); this includes both terms \\(6\\) and \\(-a\\). This is an important step; as if you don’t do this, you are violating the golden rule in not treating both sides of the equation exactly the same! To make sure you do not fall into this trap, it can be useful to use brackets to ensure everything on the right-hand side is multiplied by \\(4\\). Anyway, the next step in the rearranging is \\[3x = 4(6-a)\\] Now, dividing both sides by \\(3\\) (making sure to divide everything on the right-hand side by \\(3\\)) gives \\[x = \\frac{4(6-a)}{3}\\] and you are done.\n\n\nThere are many ways to do this question. You could do the division by \\(3\\) first, then the subtraction by \\(a/3\\), then the multiplication by \\(4\\). Here, the order of operations doesn’t matter so much, but isolating a multiple of the chosen variable on one side is often the best way to go about rearranging equations.\nThis forms the basis of the general strategy for rearranging any equation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen rearranging an equation for a variable, try to get exactly one term involving that variable on one side of the equation; then do what you need to do to isolate that variable.\n\n\nIt is also worth restating:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen multiplying/dividing one side of an equation by a number \\(a\\), make sure to multiply/divide everything on that side of an equation by \\(a\\).\n\n\nThis is a common health warning in rearranging equations, as you will see throughout the rest of the guide."

    "text": "Powers and roots\n\nUndoing powers of \\(n\\) using \\(n\\)th roots\nHow would you undo a power such as \\(x^2 = 9\\), \\(y^3 = 64\\) or even \\(x^n = a\\) (where \\(n\\geq 2\\) is a whole number)?\nThe idea is to use roots. However, there are some considerations to be made when taking the \\(n\\)th root of an equation.\nTake the first of these examples, which is \\(x^2 = 9\\). Here, you are trying to rearrange for \\(x\\), where \\(x\\) is some number than when squared gives \\(9\\). You would immediately think that \\(x = 3\\), and you’d be right; but \\(x\\) could also be \\(-3\\). How do you account for this? The idea is to use the square root symbol \\(\\sqrt{\\;}\\), but \\(x = \\sqrt{9}\\) can’t be two solutions at once. To get around this, you could define the square root symbol to always mean the positive square root of a number, and write \\(\\pm\\) to mean ‘plus or minus’. Therefore, if \\(x^2=9\\), then \\(x = \\pm \\sqrt{9} = \\pm 3\\) to rearrange for \\(x\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe square root of a negative number is not a real number. If you want to rearrange an equation like \\(x^2 = -4\\) for \\(x\\), then you will need to use complex numbers. See Guide: Introduction to complex numbers for more.\nComplex numbers are not considered in the rest of this guide.\n\n\nSo, what about \\(y^3 = 64\\)? Here there is only one number that when cubed is equal to \\(64\\); this number is \\(4\\). This is because \\((-4)^3 = -64\\). So in fact, you are able to take the cube root \\(\\sqrt[3]{\\;}\\) of any number and not have to worry about signs; if \\(y^3 = 64\\) then \\(y = \\sqrt[3]{64} = 4\\). You can contrast this to the case of the square roots!\nNow, what about \\(x^n = a\\)? If \\(n\\) is even, then \\(x^n\\) must be a square number, and so must be positive. In addition, if \\(n\\) is even then \\((-x)^n = x^n\\), and so you must also take positive and negative roots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndoing powers using \\(n\\)th roots\n\n\n\nSuppose that \\(x^n = a\\).\n\nIf \\(n\\) is even and \\(a \\geq 0\\), then \\[x = \\pm\\sqrt[n]{a}\\] where \\(\\sqrt[n]{a}\\) is the positive \\(n\\)th root of \\(a\\).\nIf \\(n\\) is odd, then \\[x = \\sqrt[n]{a}\\] where \\(\\sqrt[n]{a}\\) is the \\(n\\)th root of \\(a\\).\n\n\n\nThankfully, the situation of undoing \\(n\\)th roots using powers of \\(n\\) is not as complex (no pun intended!). Since there is no ambiguity about the sign of an \\(n\\)th root, you can raise to the power of \\(n\\) to undo the root in any case:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndoing \\(n\\)th roots using powers of \\(n\\)\n\n\n\nSuppose that \\(\\sqrt[n]{x} = a\\). Then \\(x = a^n\\).\n\n\nWhen rearranging equations involving powers of \\(n\\) and \\(n\\)th roots, you should always aim to isolate your variable on one side before undoing the power of \\(n\\) or the \\(n\\)th root. This is because:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn general, \\[a^n + b^n \\neq (a+b)^n \\quad\\textsf{ and }\\quad\\sqrt[n]{a} + \\sqrt[n]{b} \\neq \\sqrt[n]{a+b}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\n\nYou are given the equation \\(2z = 4x^2 + 5y\\). To make \\(x\\) the subject of this equation, you should isolate \\(4x^2\\) on one side of the equation like so:\n\\[4x^2 = 5y − 2z\\] Now, to apply the square root, you need to have \\(x^2\\) on its own. So divide by \\(4\\) to get\n\\[x^2 = \\frac{5y-2z}{4}\\] Now you can then take the square root of both sides to get\n\\[x = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{5y − 2z}{4}}\\] and this is your answer.\n\n\nFor roots in equations, you can use inverse operation of taking the equation to a power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\n\nIf you want to make \\(x\\) the subject of the equation \\(\\displaystyle \\sqrt[5]{\\frac{x^3}{2}} = b-1\\), you need to undo the fifth root around \\(x^3/2\\). This can be done by raising both sides to the power of \\(5\\). Following the health warning above, you must remember to raise everything on the right hand side to the power of \\(5\\). Doing this gives \\[\\frac{x^3}{2} = (b-1)^5\\] You cannot take cube roots yet however, because of that \\(2\\). Multiplying \\(2\\) from both sides gives \\[x^3 = 2(b-1)^5.\\] Now you can cube root to get \\[x = \\sqrt[3]{2(b-1)^5}\\] and you are done.\n\n\nFinally, let’s return to the initial example at the start of the guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\n\nLet’s take \\[5x^3y^3 + \\frac{6z}{w^4} = 4abc^2\\] How do you rearrange for \\(x\\)?\nFirst of all, you need to isolate the term involving \\(x\\) on one side of the equation. You can subtract \\(6z/w^4\\) from both sides of the equation to get \\[5x^3y^3 = 4abc^2 - \\frac{6z}{w^4}\\] You now need to get a power of \\(x\\) on its own by dividing through by \\(5\\) and \\(y^3\\). You can either do these separately or together. So dividing both sides of the equation by \\(5y^3\\) gives \\[x^3 = \\frac{4abc^2}{5y^3} - \\frac{6z}{5w^4y^3}\\] Now, taking the cube root of both sides gives \\[x = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{4abc^2}{5y^3} - \\frac{6z}{5w^4y^3}}\\] and this is your answer."

    "text": "The unit circle\nThe unit circle uses this relationship to represent the values of the trigonometric functions. The unit circle is a circle of radius one which is centered on the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system. Because of this, the radius represents the hypotenuse of the right angled triangle. Take \\(\\theta\\) to be the angle as measured anticlockwise from the positive \\(x\\)-axis, and suppose that \\((x,y)\\) is a point on the unit circle.\nIf \\(\\theta\\) is between \\(0\\) and \\(\\pi/2\\), then the triangle created is right angled and the above definition for \\(\\sin\\), \\(\\cos\\), \\(\\tan\\) applies. In this case, \\(\\cos(\\theta)\\) is equal to \\(x\\) and \\(\\sin(\\theta)\\) is equal to \\(y\\).\nHowever, what if \\(\\theta\\) is greater than \\(\\pi/2\\)? Here’s an example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\n\nSay you want to represent \\(\\sin(\\frac{4\\pi}{3})\\) and \\(\\cos(\\frac{4\\pi}{3})\\) on your unit circle. You would start with an unlabelled unit circle, marking on a line \\(\\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\) radians from the positive \\(x\\)-axis. Now you want to make our triangle. In this case, you can draw a triangle where one side is the negative \\(x\\)-axis. Geometrically you can split the angle into the straight line and the excess which forms our triangle. That means our triangle ‘starts’ \\(\\pi\\) radians away from the \\(x\\)-axis. This means that the angle in our triangle will be \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\) radians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Construction of triangle as in Example 1.\n\n\n\nAs you are using the unit circle, the hypotenuse will be equal to one. Then, you can label the opposite and adjacent sides as shown on the diagram above. As you know that \\(\\sin(\\theta)=\\frac{\\textsf{opposite}}{\\textsf{hypotenuse}}\\) and \\(\\cos(\\theta)=\\frac{\\textsf{adjacent}}{\\textsf{hypotenuse}}\\), you can see that the \\(y\\)-axis will represent \\(\\sin(\\theta)\\) and the \\(x\\)-axis \\(\\cos(\\theta)\\).\nSee Figure 4 for a picture of this angle on the unit circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The unit circle, with a few angles labelled to show the triangles formed; including the angle from Example 1.\n\n\n\n\nSo from Example 1, the value of \\(\\sin(4\\pi/3)\\) and \\(\\cos(4\\pi/3)\\) are the \\(y\\)-axis and the \\(x\\)-axis respectively. Together with the discussion before Example 1, this leads to a new definition of the two trigonometric functions \\(\\sin\\) and \\(\\cos\\):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of sin, cos, tan in terms of the unit circle\n\n\n\nLet \\((x,y)\\) be a point on the unit circle centred at the origin \\((0,0)\\). Let \\(\\theta\\) be the angle defined by the positive \\(x\\)-axis and the line segment from centre to the point \\((x,y)\\). Define \\[\\cos(\\theta) = x \\qquad \\sin(\\theta) = y\\] and \\[\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{y}{x} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\cos(\\theta)}\\]\n\n\nThis definition extends the trigonometric functions to situations outside right-angled triangles; dramatically increasing their usability. The figure below details how the values of \\(\\cos(t), \\sin(t), \\tan(t)\\) change as the angle \\(t\\) changes.\n\n\n\n\n \nIn the unit circle, the angle \\(\\theta\\) ranges from \\(0\\) to \\(2\\pi\\).\nOver this range, the values of the co-ordinates \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) range from positive to negative. Therefore, the three main trigonometric functions \\(\\sin\\), \\(\\cos\\) and \\(\\tan\\) take different signs in different positions.\n\nIf \\(x &gt; 0\\) and \\(y &gt; 0\\) (so \\(0 &lt; \\theta &lt; \\pi/2\\)), then both \\(\\cos(\\theta) &gt; 0\\) and \\(\\sin(\\theta) &gt; 0\\), and therefore \\(\\tan\\theta &gt; 0\\).\nIf \\(x &lt; 0\\) and \\(y &gt; 0\\) (so \\(\\pi/2 &lt; \\theta &lt; \\pi\\)), then \\(\\cos(\\theta) &lt; 0\\) and \\(\\sin(\\theta) &gt; 0\\), and therefore \\(\\tan(\\theta) &lt; 0\\).\nIf \\(x &lt; 0\\) and \\(y &lt; 0\\) (so \\(\\pi &lt; \\theta &lt; 3\\pi/2\\)), then both \\(\\cos(\\theta) &lt; 0\\) and \\(\\sin(\\theta) &lt; 0\\), and therefore \\(\\tan(\\theta) &gt; 0\\).\nIf \\(x &gt; 0\\) and \\(y &lt; 0\\) (so \\(3\\pi/2 &lt; \\theta &lt; 2\\pi\\)), then \\(\\cos(\\theta) &gt; 0\\) and \\(\\sin(\\theta) &lt; 0\\), and therefore \\(\\tan(\\theta) &lt; 0\\).\n\nSee Figure 5 for a picture of this behaviour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: A graphical depiction of signs of trigonometric functions in each quadrant.\n\n\n\nThis analysis has missed out values of the three trigonometric functions on the axes. Here \\(\\theta=0\\) along the positive \\(x\\)-axis, \\(\\theta=\\pi/2\\) along the positive \\(y\\)-axis, \\(\\theta=\\pi\\) along the negative \\(x\\)-axis, and \\(\\theta=3\\pi/2\\) along the negative \\(y\\)-axis.\n\nIf \\(\\theta = 0\\), then \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 0\\). Therefore \\(\\cos(0) = 1/1 = 1\\) and \\(\\sin(0) = \\tfrac{0}{1} = 0\\) and so \\(\\tan(0) = \\sin(0)/\\cos(0) = 0/1 = 0\\).\nIf \\(\\theta = \\pi/2\\) (right angle of positive \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes) then \\(x = 0\\) and \\(y = 1\\). Therefore \\(\\cos(\\pi/2) = 0/1 = 0\\) and \\(\\sin(\\pi/2) = 1/1 = 1\\). In this case, \\(\\tan(\\pi/2)\\) is undefined as \\(\\cos(\\pi/2) = 0\\).\nIf \\(\\theta = \\pi\\) (straight line, angle of positive \\(x\\) and negative \\(x\\) axes) then \\(x = -1\\) and \\(y = 0\\). Therefore \\(\\cos(\\pi) = -1/1 = -1\\) and \\(\\sin(\\pi) = 0/1 = 0\\). In this case, \\(\\tan(\\pi) = \\sin(\\pi)/\\cos(\\pi) = 0/(-1) = 0\\).\nIf \\(\\theta = 3\\pi/2\\) (right angle of positive \\(x\\) and negative \\(y\\) axes) then \\(x = 0\\) and \\(y = -1\\). Therefore \\(\\cos \\left(3\\pi/2\\right) = 0/1 = 0\\) and \\(\\sin\\left(3\\pi/2\\right) = -1/1 = -1\\). In this case, \\(\\tan(3\\pi/2)\\) is undefined as \\(\\cos (3\\pi/2) = 0\\)."

    "text": "Definition and initial examples\nAs was mentioned in Guide: Introduction to vectors, another thing that you can do with vectors is to multiply it with a scalar, which is usually a real number. Scalar multiplying a vector by a positive scalar typically changes the magnitude of the vector and preserves the direction, and multiplying a vector by a negative scalar typically changes the magnitude of the vector and reverses the direction. Figure 3 shows a picture of these scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Graphical representation of scalar multiplication.\n\n\n\nWhat does scalar multiplication do to the components of a vector? Suppose that you are scalar multiplying the vector \\(\\mathbf{i}\\). This is a unit vector, so has magnitude \\(1\\). Since scalar multiplication by a scalar \\(\\lambda\\) (pronounced ‘lambda’) changes the length of a vector, it follows that the vector \\(\\lambda\\mathbf{i}\\) has magnitude \\(|\\lambda|\\), the absolute value of \\(\\lambda\\).\nSince every vector \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) is the sum of scalar multiples of \\(\\mathbf{i},\\mathbf{j},\\mathbf{k}\\), it follows that \\(\\lambda\\mathbf{u}\\) is the sum of scalar multiples of \\(\\lambda\\mathbf{i},\\lambda\\mathbf{j},\\lambda\\mathbf{k}\\). This forms the basis of the definition:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of scalar multiplication\n\n\n\nLet \\(\\mathbf{a} = a_1\\mathbf{i} + a_2\\mathbf{j} + a_3\\mathbf{k}\\) be a vector and let \\(\\lambda\\) be a real number. Then the scalar multiple of \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) by \\(\\lambda\\) is given by \\[\\lambda \\mathbf{a} = \\lambda a_1\\mathbf{i} + \\lambda a_2\\mathbf{j} + \\lambda a_3\\mathbf{k}.\\]\nIn column notation, if \\(\\mathbf{a} = \\begin{bmatrix}a_1\\\\a_2\\\\a_3\\end{bmatrix}\\), then \\(\\lambda \\mathbf{a} = \\begin{bmatrix}\\lambda a_1\\\\ \\lambda a_2\\\\ \\lambda a_3 \\end{bmatrix}.\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\n\nYou are given \\(\\mathbf{a} = \\begin{bmatrix}3\\\\5\\\\6\\end{bmatrix}\\).

They have many applications in varied field such as geometry, mechanics, multivariable calculus and more. In addition, solving vector equations is one of the key studies of linear mathematics.\nOne thing to remember from Guide: Introduction to vectors is that vectors are only equal if and only if their components are individually equal. That is, if \\(\\mathbf{a} = a_1 \\mathbf{i} + a_2 \\mathbf{j} + a_3 \\mathbf{k}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b} = b_1 \\mathbf{i} + b_2 \\mathbf{j} + b_3 \\mathbf{k}\\) are two vectors, then \\[\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{b}\\quad\\textsf{ if and only if }\\quad a_1 = b_1,\\, a_2 = b_2,\\, a_3 = b_3.\\]\nThis means that to solve vector equations, you may have to solve three equations simultaneously! This requires an excellent knowledge of solving simultaneous equations; see Guide: Introduction to solving simultaneous equations for more.\nSolving vector equations is best done when following the lead of examples; here are two. The first of these involves position vectors: see Guide: Introduction to vectors for more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 9\n\n\n\nIf the co-ordinates of the point \\(B\\) are \\((-5,-2,-4)\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} = \\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\1\\\\-6\\end{bmatrix}\\), what are the co-ordinates of \\(A\\)?\nUsing knowledge from Guide: Introduction to vectors, you can say that the position vector of the point \\(B\\) is \\[\\overrightarrow{OB} = \\begin{bmatrix}-5\\\\-2\\\\-4\\end{bmatrix}\\]\nIf you can find the value of the position vector \\(\\overrightarrow{OA}\\), then you can read off the co-ordinates of the point \\(A\\). Using the definition of vector addition, you can write that \\[\\overrightarrow{OB} = \\overrightarrow{OA} + \\overrightarrow{AB}\\] and so \\(\\overrightarrow{OA} = \\overrightarrow{OB} - \\overrightarrow{AB}\\). Therefore \\[\\overrightarrow{OA} = \\overrightarrow{OB} - \\overrightarrow{AB}= \\begin{bmatrix}-5\\\\-2\\\\-4\\end{bmatrix} - \\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\1\\\\-6\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}-6\\\\-3\\\\2\\end{bmatrix}\\] and so the co-ordinates of \\(A\\) are \\((-6,-3,2)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 10\n\n\n\nIf \\(\\mathbf{u} = 4\\mathbf{i} + 3\\mathbf{j}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v} = -\\mathbf{i} + 2\\mathbf{j}\\), how can you express \\(7\\mathbf{i} + 19\\mathbf{j}\\) in terms of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\)?\nWhat you can do here is take the sum of scalar multiples of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) (known as a linear combination) and set this vector equal to \\(7\\mathbf{i} + 19 \\mathbf{j}\\). It is important that you take these two scalars to be potentially different, so give them different names like \\(\\lambda\\) (‘lambda’) and \\(\\mu\\) (‘mu’). So \\[7\\mathbf{i} + 19 \\mathbf{j} = \\lambda \\mathbf{u} + \\mu \\mathbf{v}\\] Since \\(\\mathbf{u} = 4\\mathbf{i} + 3\\mathbf{j}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v} = -\\mathbf{i} + 2\\mathbf{j}\\), this becomes \\[7\\mathbf{i} + 19 \\mathbf{j} = (4\\lambda \\mathbf{i} + 3\\lambda\\mathbf{j}) + (-\\mu\\mathbf{i} + 2\\mu\\mathbf{j})\\] These two vectors are equal if and only if their components are equal. Therefore, this gives two simultaneous equations\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n7 &= 4\\lambda - \\mu & (\\mathbf{i}\\textsf{ component})\\\\\n19 &= 3\\lambda + 2\\mu & (\\mathbf{j}\\textsf{ component})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSolving these equations (see Guide: Introduction to solving simultaneous equations for more) gives \\(\\lambda = 3\\) and \\(\\mu = 5\\), and so \\[7\\mathbf{i} + 19\\mathbf{j} = 3\\mathbf{u} + 5\\mathbf{v}.\\]"

If you can use the chain rule to demonstrate a general formula for the derivative of \\(1/f(x)\\), you can not only use this general formula to differentiate \\(\\sec(x)\\) and \\(\\csc(x)\\), but any other reciprocal function. This is a common technique amongst mathematicians; find the most general formula possible to apply to as many situations as you can. Let’s take a look at the reciprocal rule:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 8 (reciprocal rule)\n\n\n\nYou can use the chain rule to prove the reciprocal rule, which says that if \\(f(x)\\) is not equal to \\(0\\) for all \\(x\\), then \\[\\left(\\frac{1}{f(x)}\\right)' = \\frac{-f(x)}{(f(x))^2}.\\]\nThe function you are trying to differentiate is \\(y = 1/f(x)\\), so you can use the chain rule with \\(y(u) = 1/u = u^{-1}\\) and \\(u(x) = f(x)\\). Differentiating \\(y\\) with respect to \\(u\\) gives \\(\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}u} = -u^{-2} = -1/u^2\\), and differentiating \\(u\\) with respect to \\(x\\) gives \\(\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}x} = f'(x)\\).

For instance, in Example 1, you saw that the derivative of \\(e^{x^3}\\) is equal to \\(3x^2e^{x^3}\\). Taking \\(f(x) = x^3\\), you can see that this is equal to the derivative \\(f'(x) = 3x^2\\) multiplied by \\(e^{f(x)}\\). It follows that you can use the chain rule to prove that, for any function \\(f(x)\\): \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(e^{f(x)}\\right) = f'(x)e^{f(x)}\\]\nSimilarly, in Example 2, you saw that the derivative of \\(f(x) = \\ln(x^5)\\) was \\(5x^4/x^5\\), which is the derivative of \\(x^5\\) divided by \\(x^5\\). This is no coincidence; using the chain rule, you can show that for any function \\(f(x)\\): \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(\\ln(f(x))\\right) = \\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}\\]"

It was mentioned that the chain rule was used to find these expanded derivatives; but why was this the case? The answer is that is because of the \\(bx\\) in the arguments of the function. Technically, an expression like \\(f(x) = a\\cos(bx)\\) is the composition of two functions, \\(f(u) = a\\cos(u)\\) and \\(u(x) = bx\\).

    "text": "Examples\nHere’s some examples of differentiation in action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n\nFind the derivative of the function \\(f(x) = \\dfrac{x^2}{2} + 1\\) with respect to \\(x\\).\nHere, you can use the sum and scaling rules to differentiate this function. Using the sum rule, you can see that \\[\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(\\dfrac{x^2}{2} + 1\\right) = \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(\\dfrac{x^2}{2}\\right) + \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(1\\right)\\] Now, using the scaling rule on the first of these terms, you can get \\[\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(\\dfrac{x^2}{2}\\right) + \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(1\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(x^2\\right) + \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(1\\right)\\]\nNow you can use the derivatives of common functions. The function \\(x^2\\) is of the form \\(x^n\\), so the derivative of \\(x^2\\) is \\(2x^{2-1} = 2x^1 = 2x\\). The function \\(1\\) is a constant, so the derivative of \\(1\\) is \\(0\\). Putting these results in gives \\[\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(x^2\\right) + \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(1\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(2x) + 0\\] Simplifying gives the answer: \\(\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(\\dfrac{x^2}{2} + 1\\right) = x\\) and so the derivative of \\(f(x) = x^2/2 + 1\\) is equal to \\(f'(x) = x\\).\nYou can then say that this function \\(f(x) = x^2/2 + 1\\) is increasing if \\(x &gt; 0\\), decreasing if \\(x &lt; 0\\), and is stationary exactly when \\(x = 0\\).\n\n\nYou do not need to be so meticulous in your general practice when differentiating. You can differentiate functions without stating what rules you are using.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\n\nDifferentiate \\(f(x) = 4e^{3x} - \\sqrt{x}\\) with respect to \\(x\\).\nOf these two terms, \\(4e^{3x}\\) looks like a common function, but you have not seen how to differentiate \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) yet. In fact, this is another case of \\(x^n\\); in this case, \\(n = 1/2\\). (See Guide: Laws of indices for why this is.)\nYou can then rewrite the function as \\[f(x) = 4e^{3x} - x^{1/2}\\] which you can then apply your knowledge of differentiation to. Using the results above, the derivative of \\(4e^{3x}\\) is \\(4\\cdot3\\cdot e^{3x} = 12e^{3x}\\). The derivative of \\(x^{1/2}\\) is \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)x^{1/2 - 1} = \\dfrac{x^{-1/2}}{2}\\). Therefore, the derivative of \\(4e^{3x} - \\sqrt{x}\\) is \\[f'(x) = 12e^{3x} - \\frac{x^{-1/2}}{2}\\]\nYou could turn \\(x^{-1/2}\\) into \\(1/\\sqrt{x}\\); however, you may be asked to differentiate this function again (particularly if you are looking into behaviour of a function), and often it is best to leave the power as a real number rather than using the square root notation.\n\n\nAs a rule of thumb, you should always write an \\(n\\)th root using a fractional power instead. Here’s another example of where you should write a term involving a power of \\(x\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\n\nFind the derivative of the function \\(f(t) = \\dfrac{1}{t^4} + 4\\cos(t) - \\sin(4t)\\) with respect to \\(t\\).\nAgain, the cosine and sine terms are manageable from the derivative above, it is only the \\(1/t^4\\) term that needs a little thought. In fact, this is yet another case of \\(t^n\\); this time when \\(n = -4\\). (See Guide: Laws of indices for why this is.)\nYou can then rewrite the function as \\[f(t) = t^{-4} + 4\\sin(t) - \\cos(4t)\\] and use the familiar rules of differentiation above. Using the results above with \\(n = -4\\), the derivative of \\(t^{-4}\\) is \\(-4t^{-4-1} = -4t^{-5}\\). The derivative of \\(4\\sin(t)\\) is \\(4(\\cos(t)) = 4\\cos(t)\\). The derivative of \\(\\cos(4t)\\) is \\(-4\\sin(4t)\\). Taking care of your signs you can write the derivative of \\(\\dfrac{1}{t^4} + 4\\cos(t) - \\sin(4t)\\) as \\[f'(t) = -4t^{-5} + 4\\cos(t) - (-4\\sin(4t)) = -4t^{-5} + 4\\cos(t) + 4\\sin(4t).\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\n\nDetermine the behaviour of the function \\(f(x) = 2\\ln(3x) - x\\) when \\(x = 1\\).\nHere, you will first need to differentiate the function \\(f(x)\\) to find \\(f'(x)\\). Then, you will need to evaluate the derivative \\(f'(x)\\) when \\(x = 1\\) to see how the function behaves.\nUsing your rules of differentiation as you found above, you can say that the derivative of \\(2\\ln(3x)\\) is \\(2/x\\), and the derivative of \\(x\\) is \\(1\\). Therefore, the derivative of the function \\(f(x) = 2\\ln(3x) - x\\) is \\[f'(x) = \\frac{2}{x} - 1.\\] You can evaluate the derivative \\(f'(x)\\) at \\(x = 1\\) to get \\[f'(1) = \\frac{2}{1} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1\\] and so the derivative is positive at \\(x = 1\\). This implies that the function \\(f(x) = 2\\ln(3x) - x\\) is increasing at the point \\(x = 1\\).\nIt also means that the gradient of the tangent to the function \\(f(x)\\) at the point \\((1,2\\ln(3) - 1)\\) is \\(1\\). You can see this in the figure below."

So \\[a^{1/n} = \\sqrt[n]{a}.\\]\nFor example: suppose you found that \\[2^r·2^r=2\\] This means that multiplying \\(2^r\\) by \\(2^r\\) gives the result \\(2\\). You know that \\(2=2^1\\), so consider Law 1, \\(2^r·2^r=2^{2r}\\). If \\(2^r·2^r=2\\) then you can get \\[2^{2r}=2^1\\] from which \\(r=1\\); so \\(r=\\frac{1}{2}\\).This shows that \\[2^{\\frac{1}{2}}=\\sqrt[2]{2}=\\sqrt{2}\\]\nWhat about an expression of the form \\(a^{r/n}\\), where \\(r\\) is a real number and \\(n\\) is a positive whole number?

    "text": "Case 1: \\(a = 1\\)\nWhen the quadratic expression has the form \\(x^2+bx+c\\), the aim is to find two numbers \\(d\\) and \\(e\\) that multiply to \\(c\\), and add to \\(b\\), such that \\(de = c\\) and \\(d+e=b\\). If you can do this, then you can rewrite the expression as \\[x^2 + bx + c = x^2+(d+e)x+de.\\] You can expand the brackets to see that \\[x^2+(d+e)x+de = x^2+dx+ex+de.\\] \\(x\\) is a common factor of the first two terms, and \\(e\\) is a common factor of the second two terms, you can factorize using the techniques above to get \\[x^2+dx+ex+de = x(x+d) + e(x+d)\\] Since \\((x+d)\\) is a common factor of both of the terms \\(x(x+d)\\) and \\(e(x+d)\\), you can factorize again to get \\[x^2 + bx + c = x(x+d) + e(x+d) = (x+d)(x+e).\\]\nThis is the desired form of the quadratic expression! It is best to see this process explained with an example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 9\n\n\n\nFactorize \\(x^2+7x+10\\) into a product of two bracketed expressions.\nYou want to find two numbers that multiply to make \\(10\\) and add to make \\(7\\).\nThe positive factors of \\(10\\) are \\(1, 2, 5,\\) and \\(10.\\)\nYou want to look at the factors and see which pairings multiply to make \\(10\\). These are:\n\\[1\\cdot 10=10 \\quad \\textsf{and} \\quad2 \\cdot 5=10.\\] Since \\(2+5=7\\) and \\(1+10=11\\neq7\\), you pick the correct factors of \\(10\\), which are \\(2\\) and \\(5\\). You can now write the factorized form of your quadratic expression by writing two brackets and putting the variable \\(x\\) at the start of each one:\n\\[(x  + ?  )(x + ?  )\\]\nWrite one factor in the first bracket and the other factor in the second bracket, to give the final factorized form:\n\\[x^2+7x+10=(x+2)(x+5).\\]\n\n\nHere’s an example with a negative \\(bx\\) term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf the \\(bx\\) term is negative, and the \\(+c\\) is positive, the two factors must both be negative, as two negatives multiplied together creates a positive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 10\n\n\n\nFactorize \\(x^2-5x+6\\).\nYou want to find two numbers that multiply to make \\(6\\) and add to make \\(-5\\).\nNow, you need to consider all the factors, positive and negative, of \\(6\\).\nThe factors of \\(6\\) are \\(1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, 6,\\) and \\(-6\\).\nYou want to look at the factors and see which pairings multiply to make \\(6\\) and add to \\(-5\\). These are:\n\\[(-2) \\cdot (-3)=6\\quad \\textsf{and} \\quad(-2)+(-3)=-5.\\]\nSo, \\(-2\\) and \\(-3\\) are the correct factors to use.\nNow, put them into the brackets in a similar fashion to Example 9, to give the final factorized form: \\[x^2-5x+6=(x-2)(x-3).\\]\n\n\nFinally, here’s an example where the \\(+c\\) term is negative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf the \\(+c\\) term is negative, and the \\(bx\\) term is positive, one factor must be negative, and the other positive, as a positive and a negative multiplied together gives a negative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 11\n\n\n\nFactorize \\(x^2+x-2\\).\nNow, you need to consider all the factors, positive and negative, of \\(-2\\).\nThe factors of \\(-2\\) are \\(1, -1, 2\\), and \\(-2\\). You want to look at the factors and see which pairings multiply to make \\(-2\\) and add to \\(1\\). These are: \\[2 \\cdot (-1)=-2\\quad \\textsf{and} \\quad 2+(-1)=1.\\]\nSo \\(2\\) and \\(-1\\) are the correct factors to use.\nNow, put them into the brackets in a similar fashion to Example 9, to give the final factorized form: \\[x^2+x-1=(x+2)(x-1).\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe order of the factors don’t matter, but the signs do!\nExample 11 is an example of this - if the signs of the factors were swapped, it would result in a different quadratic to the one you have been asked to factorize. If you swapped the signs, you would get \\((x-2)(x+1)\\). When expanded, this gives: \\[(x-2)(x+1) = x^2 -2x +x -2\\] \\[ = x^2 -x -2\\] \\[x^2 -x -2 \\neq x^2+x-2.\\]\n\\(x^2 -x -2\\) is not the original quadratic expression you were asked to factorize, which shows you how if a factor has the incorrect sign, the required quadratic expression will not be factorized correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf \\(c=0\\), you can factorize the quadratic expression using the common factor \\(x\\). This is because if \\(c=0\\), then: \\[ax^2 +bx +c = ax^2 + bx.\\] Which can then be factorized as: \\[ax^2 + bx = x(ax + b).\\] If \\(a=1\\), this is still true, and is factorized as: \\[x^2 + bx = x(x + b).\\]\nExample 7 is an example where \\(a \\neq 0\\) and \\(c=0\\)."

    "text": "Case 2: \\(a \\neq 1\\)\nWhen a quadratic expression has the form \\(ax^2+bx+c\\), it can still be factorized, but it requires a different method from the one you used when \\(a=1\\).\nThe aim is to find two numbers \\(d\\) and \\(e\\) such that: \\[d \\cdot e = a \\cdot c \\quad \\textsf{and} \\quad d + e =b.\\]\nThis works because you can rewrite the middle term (\\(bx\\)) as \\(dx+ex\\), which allows you to factorize by grouping. So if you rewrite the expression, it becomes: \\[ax^2+bx+c= ax^2+dx + ex+c.\\] You can now group the expression: \\[ax^2+dx + ex+c = (ax^2+dx) + (ex+c).\\] Factorizing each bracket gives: \\[\\left( ax^2 + dx \\right) + \\left( ex+c \\right) = a x \\left( x+\\dfrac{d}{a} \\right) + e \\left( x+\\dfrac{c}{e} \\right).\\] Since \\(d \\cdot e = a \\cdot c\\) from the start of your working, dividing both sides by \\(ae\\) gives \\(\\dfrac{d}{a}=\\dfrac{c}{e}\\). You can define this as a value \\(f\\), where \\(f=\\dfrac{d}{a}=\\dfrac{c}{e}\\), and substitute this in to give: \\[(ax^2+dx) + (ex+c) = ax(x+f) + e(x + f).\\] This means that both groups will share the common factor \\((x+f)\\), and the expression can be factorized further to give: \\[(ax^2+dx) + (ex+c) = (ax+e)(x+f).\\] This is the fully factorized form of the quadratic expression \\(ax^2+bx+c\\) when \\(a \\neq 1\\).\nThese are the steps to factorize a quadratic of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\):\n\nMultiply \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) together.\nFind two numbers that multiply to give \\(a \\cdot c\\), and add to give \\(b\\).\nRewrite the middle term using these two numbers.\nFactorize by grouping as above.\n\nYou can see that this method extends Case 1 (where \\(a = 1\\)). If \\(a=1\\), then in this case \\(a\\cdot c = c\\) and this method then reduces to the above. Let’s see an example\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 12\n\n\n\nFactorize \\(2x^2+5x+3\\).\nYou can follow the steps above.\n\nFirst, you need to multiply \\(2\\) and \\(3\\) together: \\(2 \\cdot 3=6.\\)\nNow you need to consider all the factors of \\(6\\), which are \\(1,2,3,\\) and \\(6\\). You want to look at the factors and see which pairings multiply to make \\(6\\), and add to \\(5\\). These are: \\[2+3=5\\quad \\textsf{and} \\quad 2\\cdot 3=6.\\]\nNow you can rewrite the original expression, but this time splitting the middle (\\(bx\\)) term into the two factors you found earlier: \\[2x^2+5x+3= 2x^2+2x+3x+3.\\]\nIf you now look at the expression in two halves, there is a common factor for each half, and you can factorize by grouping:\n\n\\[2x^2+5x+3= 2x^2+2x+3x+3= 2x(x+1)+3(x+1).\\] Now, this is similar to the type of factorizing you did in single bracket factorization!\nYou can now take out the the \\((x+1)\\) common factor, to give the result: \\[2x(x+1)+3(x+1)=(2x+3)(x+1).\\] And this gives you your final factorized answer: \\[2x^2+5x+3=(2x+3)(x+1).\\]\n\n\nYou don’t have to use the steps prescriptively in every example; it was only for instructive purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 13\n\n\n\nFactorize \\(3x^2-2x-5\\).\nYou need to multiply \\(3\\) and \\(-5\\) together: \\[3 \\cdot (-5)=-15.\\]\nYou need to find the factors of \\(-15\\) that multiply to give \\(-15\\), and add to give \\(-2\\). These are: \\[3 + (-5) =-2\\quad \\textsf{and} \\quad 3 \\cdot (-5)=-15.\\]\nNow you can rewrite the original expression, but this time splitting the middle (\\(bx\\)) term into the two factors you found earlier: \\[3x^2-2x-5= 3x^2+3x-5x-5.\\]\nIf you look at the expression in two halves, there is a common factor for each half, and you can factorize by grouping: \\[3x^2-2x-5= 3x^2+3x-5x-5= 3x(x+1)-5(x+1).\\]\nYou can now remove the \\((x+1)\\) common factor, to give the result: \\[3x(x+1)-5(x+1)=(3x-5)(x+1).\\]\nAnd you can write your final factorized answer: \\[3x^2-2x-5=(3x+5)(x+1).\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nNote that a quadratic \\(ax^2+bx+c\\) can sometimes be factorized in the form: \\[(px+q)(rx+s)\\quad \\textsf{where} \\quad p,r \\neq 0.\\]\nHowever, if you factorize out \\(r\\) from each term you get:\n\\[\\left( px+q \\right)\\left( rx+s \\right) = \\dfrac{1}{r^2} \\left( \\left( \\dfrac{px}{r} + \\dfrac{q}{r} \\right) \\left( x+\\dfrac{s}{r} \\right) \\right).\\]\nThis matches the factorized result of \\(ax^2+bx+c\\), so a factorization like \\((px+q)(rx+s)\\) can be expressed using rational numbers to match any desired form. This can be seen as: \\[\\left( \\dfrac{px}{r} + \\dfrac{q}{r} \\right) \\left( x+\\dfrac{s}{r} \\right) = \\left( dx+e \\right) \\left( x+f \\right),\n\\quad \\textsf{where} \\quad d=\\dfrac{p}{r} \\textsf{,} \\quad e=\\dfrac{q}{r} \\quad \\textsf{and} \\quad f=\\dfrac{s}{r}.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 14\n\n\n\nFactorize \\(4x^2+4x-3\\).\nFirst, you need to multiply \\(4\\) and \\(-3\\) together: \\[4 \\cdot (-3) = -12.\\]\nYou need to find the factors of \\(-12\\) that multiply to give \\(-12\\), and add to give \\(4\\). These are:\n\\[(-2) + 6 =4\\quad \\textsf{and} \\quad(-2) \\cdot 6=-12.\\]\nNow you can rewrite the original expression, but this time splitting the middle (\\(bx\\)) term into the two factors you found earlier.\n\\[4x^2+4x-3= 4x^2-2x+6x-3.\\]\nIf you look at the expression in two halves, there is a common factor for each half, and you can factorize by grouping. Remember to use the HCF here so you can factorize fully!\n\\[4x^2+4x-3= 4x^2-2x+6x-3= 2x(2x-1)+3(2x-1).\\] Finally, you can remove the \\((2x+3)\\) common factor, to give the result: \\[2x(2x-1)+3(2x-1)=(2x-1)(2x+3).\\]\nAnd this is your final factorized answer: \\[4x^2+4x-3= 2x(2x-1)+3(2x-1)=(2x-1)(2x+3).\\]"

That is to say, if the random variable \\(X\\) is lognormally distributed, then the random variable \\(Y = \\ln(X)\\) is normally distributed (where \\(\\ln\\) is the natural logarithm).\nNotation: \\(X \\sim \\textrm{Lognormal}(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\)\nParameters: As with the normal distribution, two numbers \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) where:\nExample: The logarithms of Cantor’s Confectionery’s stock prices follow a normal distribution. The mean of the stock prices’ natural logarithms is \\(8.01\\), whereas the variance of the stock prices’ natural logarithms is \\(3\\). This can be expressed as \\(X \\sim \\textrm{Lognormal}(8.01, 3)\\), meaning the logarithm of the location parameter is \\(8.01\\) and the logarithm of scale parameter is \\(3\\)."

This distribution is used for continuous random variables with heavier tails than the normal distribution, and it is often employed in hypothesis testing where the population standard deviation is unknown. (See Guide: Introduction to hypothesis testing for more.)\nNotation: \\(X \\sim t(\\nu)\\)\nParameter: The integer \\(\\nu\\) representing the degrees of freedom.\nExample: You have a sample of 40 measurements of Cantor’s Confectionery chocolate bar lengths. From this, you would like to conduct a one sample \\(t\\)-test comparing the sample to a hypothesized mean. You find the degrees of freedom:\n\\[\n\\textsf{degrees of freedom = sample size} - 1 = 40 - 1 = 39\n\\]\nThe \\(t\\) distribution, which will be used as a reference distribution for the \\(t\\)-test, can be expressed as \\(X \\sim t(39)\\), meaning the degrees of freedom is 39.

Hence, the random variable \\(0 \\leq X \\leq 1\\).\nNotation: \\(X \\sim \\textrm{Beta}(\\alpha,\\beta)\\)\nParameters: Two positive real numbers \\(\\alpha,\\beta\\), which are shape parameters. These can be specified as follows in terms of \\(n\\) and \\(k\\) where \\(n\\) is the number of Bernoulli trials and \\(k\\) is the number of successes:\nExample: Cantor’s Confectionery is visited by 10 customers, and 6 of them purchase something from the store. Taking the buying customers as successes and the total visiting customers as number of trials, there would be 6 successes, allowing you to find the following parameters:\nThen the distribution of the probabilities of a customer purchasing from Cantor’s Confectionery can be expressed as \\(X \\sim \\textrm{Beta}(7,5)\\), meaning the first shape parameter is 7 and the second shape parameter is 5."

You decide to stop flipping the coin once you get a ‘heads’. Taking ‘heads’ as a success, this can be expressed as \\(X \\sim \\textrm{Geometric}(0.5)\\). It means the probability of success is \\(0.5\\), and you will stop conducting trials after you reach a success."

The use of this distribution is often justified by the Central Limit Theorem: as the sample size increases, the distribution of sample means will resemble a normal distribution more and more closely.\nNotation: \\(X \\sim \\textrm{Normal}(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\) or \\(X \\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\)\nParameters: Two real numbers \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\).\nExample: The lengths of chocolate bars produced by Cantor’s Confectionery follow a normal distribution with a mean of \\(5.6\\) inches and a variance of \\(1.44\\). This can be expressed as \\(X \\sim N(5.6, 1.44)\\), meaning the data is normally distributed, centered at \\(5.6\\) with standard deviation \\(\\sqrt{1.44} = 1.2\\)."

For \\(\\mathbf{a}= \\mathbf{i}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}= \\mathbf{j}\\), the scalar product is \\(\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b} = 0\\).\nAs the scalar product of \\(\\mathbf{a}= \\mathbf{i}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}= \\mathbf{j}\\) is \\(0\\), they are perpendicular to each other. This is true for any combination of any distinct pair of \\(\\mathbf{i}\\), \\(\\mathbf{j}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{k}\\). However, since any vector is parallel to itself, it follows that \\(\\mathbf{i}\\cdot \\mathbf{i} = |\\mathbf{i}||\\mathbf{i}| = |1||1| = 1\\); similar results hold for \\(\\mathbf{j}\\cdot \\mathbf{j}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot \\mathbf{k}\\)."

By the laws of vector addition, \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} = \\overrightarrow{AO} + \\overrightarrow{OB} = -\\overrightarrow{OA} + \\overrightarrow{OB}\\), where \\(\\overrightarrow{OA}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{OB}\\) are the respective coordinates of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) written in vector form. You can find \\(\\overrightarrow{AB}\\) by solving the above equation. \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} = \\begin{bmatrix}-2-3\\\\5-4\\\\7-5\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}-5\\\\1\\\\2\\end{bmatrix}\\)\n4.2.\\(\\overrightarrow{AB} = \\begin{bmatrix}4\\\\6\\\\0\\end{bmatrix}\\), \\(\\overrightarrow{AC} = \\begin{bmatrix}-2\\\\-4\\\\-5\\end{bmatrix}\\). \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} - \\overrightarrow{AC} = \\begin{bmatrix}6\\\\10\\\\5\\end{bmatrix}\\). You can also calculate this by noticing \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} - \\overrightarrow{AC} = \\overrightarrow{CA} + \\overrightarrow{AB} = \\overrightarrow{CB}\\). Then \\(\\overrightarrow{CB} = \\begin{bmatrix}6-0\\\\11-1\\\\7-2\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}6\\\\10\\\\5\\end{bmatrix}\\) as required.\n\n4.3. \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} = \\overrightarrow{OB} - \\overrightarrow{OA}\\). \\(\\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\5\\\\9\\end{bmatrix} - \\begin{bmatrix}a_1\\\\a_2\\\\a_3\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}6\\\\7\\\\-2\\end{bmatrix}\\).

Solving this gives \\(x = 3\\), \\(y = 1\\) and \\(z = -6\\).\n4.6. As they are parallel \\(\\mathbf{a} = \\lambda \\mathbf{b}\\) for some real scalar \\(\\lambda\\). This gives the simultaneous equations \\[\\begin{align*}\nx - 7 &= -2\\lambda \\tag{\\textsf{$\\mathbf{i}$ component}}\\\\\n5x+1 &= 8\\lambda \\tag{\\textsf{$\\mathbf{k}$ component}}\n\\end{align*}\\] Eliminating \\(\\lambda\\) and solving gives \\(x = 3\\)."

This can be expressed as \\(X \\sim U(1,6)\\). It means \\(1\\) is the minimum value and \\(6\\) is the maximum value, where all discrete values of \\(X\\) for \\(1 \\leq x \\leq 6\\) are equally likely."

It is commonly used as a reference distribution in hypothesis testing to compare two variances or more than two means, such as Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests.\nNotation: \\(X \\sim F(d_{1},d_{2})\\)\nParameters: Two integers \\(d_1\\) and \\(d_2\\), where - \\(d_{1}\\) degrees of freedom for the random variable \\(X\\sim \\chi^2(d_{1})\\). - \\(d_{2}\\) degrees of freedom for the random variable \\(Y\\sim \\chi^2(d_{2})\\).\nExample: You have three independent groups of data containing Cantor’s Confectionery chocolate bar lengths, and the total sample size is 90. From this, you would like to conduct an ANOVA test investigating if there is a statistically significant difference between the means of each group. You can find the degrees of freedom using the following methods:\nThe \\(F\\) distribution, which will be used as a reference distribution for the ANOVA test, can be expressed as \\(X \\sim F(2,87)\\), meaning the numerator degrees of freedom is \\(2\\) and the denominator degrees of freedom is \\(87\\)."

It can serve as an alternative to the Poisson distribution, as the Poisson distribution assumes that the mean is equal to the variance. \\(X\\) represents the number of trials required to reach the targeted number of successes \\(r\\).\nNotation: \\(X \\sim \\textrm{NB}(r,p)\\)\nParameters: Two numbers \\(r,p\\) where:\nExample: You flip a coin multiple times, and the probability of getting ‘heads’ is \\(0.5\\). You decide to stop flipping the coin once you get \\(3\\) ‘heads’; these do not have to be consecutive. Taking ‘heads’ as a success, this can be expressed as \\(X \\sim \\textrm{NB}(3,0.5)\\). It means the probability of success is \\(0.5\\), and you will stop conducting trials after you reach \\(3\\) successes."

When the probability is \\(0\\), there is no possibility of the event happening, and when the probability is \\(1\\), the event will definitely happen. Therefore, probability cannot be less than \\(0\\), and it cannot be more than \\(1\\).\nMore formally, if \\(A\\) is an event contained in a sample space \\(S\\), then: \\[0 \\leq \\mathbb{P}(A) \\leq 1.\\]\nThe probabilities of all outcomes in an event always add up to \\(1\\).\nThis can be expressed more formally as: \\[\\sum_{x\\in S}P(x)=1\\]\n\n\n\nFor example, when flipping a coin, the probability of getting heads is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) (a number between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\)), and the probability of getting tails is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). You can add these up together to get: \\[\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}=1\\]\nNotice that, in this case, the probability of ‘heads’ is equal to the probability of ‘tails’ not occurring, and the probability of ‘tails’ is equal to the probability of ‘heads’ not occurring. Therefore, ‘heads’ and ‘tails’ can be called complementary events. You could then, for example, subtract the probability of ‘heads’ from 1 to get the probability of ‘tails’. \\[\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{tails})=1-\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{tails'})=1-\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{heads})=1-\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{2}\\] This is known as the complement rule."

It’s important to say here that each of the outcomes are equally likely - you have no more probability to roll a six than you do any other number.\nSo, what is the probability of the event where you roll a \\(6\\)? Here, there is one desired outcome - a \\(6\\). The total number of possible outcomes is \\(6\\). Therefore, the probability of rolling a \\(6\\) is: \\[\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{roll a 6}) = \\frac{1}{6}.\\]\nSo, what is the probability of the event where you roll an odd number? Here, there is three desired outcomes - \\(1\\), \\(3\\) and \\(5\\). The total number of possible outcomes is still \\(6\\). Therefore, the probability of rolling an odd number is: \\[\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{roll an odd number}) = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}.\\]\nFinally, what is the probability of not rolling a \\(6\\)? You could work this out using the complement rule. The probability of not rolling a \\(6\\) is the same as \\(1\\) minus the probability of rolling a \\(6\\). Therefore, the probability of not rolling a \\(6\\) is: \\[\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{(roll a 6)}') = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{roll a 6}) = 1- \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{5}{6}.\\] This is the power of the complement rule!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of experimental probability\n\n\n\nExperimental probability is probability based on what actually happens.\n\n\nHere is how you can find experimental probability:\n\\[\n\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{event})=\\frac{\\textsf{number of times that a desired event occurs}}{\\textsf{total number of trials in an experiment}}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\n\nSuppose you flip a coin 1000 times. The probability of ‘tails’ may initially be higher or lower than 0.5. However, the more flips you do, the more the probability of ‘tails’ will tend to 0.5. This is an example of the law of large numbers: the more trials you do, the closer your experimental probability will get to the theoretical probability.\nYou can try this for yourself in the following interactive app:\n\n\n#| '!! shinylive warning !!': |\n#|   shinylive does not work in self-contained HTML documents.\n#|   Please set `embed-resources: false` in your metadata.\n#| standalone: true\n#| viewerHeight: 360\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(bslib)\n\n# Hard-coded hex color for the button (blue color requested)\nBUTTON_COLOR &lt;- \"#3F6BB6\"\n\nui &lt;- page_fluid(\n  title = \"Coin Flipper\",\n  \n  card(\n    card_header(\"Coin Flipper\"),\n    card_body(\n      # Use a row layout for landscape orientation\n      layout_columns(\n        col_widths = c(4, 4, 4), # Equal width columns\n        \n        # Left column: Description and stats\n        card(\n          card_body(\n            div(\n              style = \"display: flex;

This is particularly true when \\(a\\) is not equal to \\(1\\).\nThe advantage of the quadratic formula is that solutions to quadratic equations are always obtainable using this method.

    "section": "Initial examples",
    "text": "Initial examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n\nSolve \\(x^{\\frac{1}{2}}=8\\).\nYou can start squaring both sides of the equation to get \\((x^{\\frac{1}{2}})^2 = 8^2\\). Using Law 3, \\((x^{1/2})^2 = x^{2/2} = x\\); so then you get the answer \\(x = 64\\). To check if the answer is correct, you can substitute \\(64\\) back into the equation: \\(64^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt[2]{64}=8\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\n\nSolve \\(x^{-2}=9\\).\nUsing Law 5, \\(x^{-2} = 9\\) can be re-expressed as \\(\\frac{1}{x^2} = 9\\). Multiplying both sides by \\(x^2\\) gives you \\(1=9x^2\\). Then dividing both sides by \\(9\\) gives you \\(\\frac{1}{9}=x^2\\). Remembering you can have positive and negative roots, you get \\(x= \\frac{1}{3}\\) or \\(x= -\\frac{1}{3}\\) as the two solutions to this equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\n\nSolve \\(3^{4x}=27^{5-x}\\).\nYou can notice here that the two sides of the equation have different bases; so you need to write these in the same base. As \\(27=3^3\\), the equation can be rewritten as: \\(3^{4x}=(3^3)^{5-x}\\). Then using Law 3, you can write \\(3^{4x}=3^{15-3x}\\). Since the bases of both sides are equal, you can say that \\(4x=15-3x\\). Rearranging gives \\(x= 15/7\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\n\nSolve \\(x^{\\frac{5}{3}} + 3x^{\\frac{2}{3}} = 10x^{-\\frac{1}{3}}\\).\nIf you look at all of the indices in the question, the denominator is \\(3\\) and that is a hint of what you need to multiply by. Multiply by \\(x^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\) on both sides of the equation; using Law 1, this gives \\[\\begin{align*}\nx^{\\frac{5}{3}}\\cdot x^{\\frac{1}{3}} + 3x^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\cdot x^{\\frac{1}{3}} &= 10x^{-\\frac{1}{3}}\\cdot x^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\\\\nx^{\\frac{6}{3}} + 3x^{\\frac{3}{3}} &= 10x^0\n\\end{align*}\\] Using Law 4, you can further simplify this expression to get \\(x^2 +3x = 10\\), and so \\(x^2+3x-10=0\\). This is a quadratic equation; factorizing this equation gives you \\((x+5)(x-2)=0\\), then you can get \\(x=-5\\) and \\(x=2\\) as the two possible solutions to this equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\n\nSolve \\(2^{x+1}\\cdot 3^x =72\\).\nHere, you will need to condense the left-hand side into a single base. Using Law 1, you can write that \\[2^{x+1}\\cdot 3^x = 2(2^x\\cdot 3^x) = 72.\\] Next, use Law 7 to combine \\(2^x\\) and \\(3^x\\) into a single base; \\[2(2^x\\cdot 3^x) = 2((2\\cdot 3)^x) = 2\\cdot 6^x = 72.\\] Therefore, \\(6^x = 36\\). Since \\(36 = 6^2\\), it follows that \\(x = 2\\). (Or indeed, you could have taken logarithms of both sides to base \\(6\\).)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\n\nSolve \\(\\sqrt{(6x)^3}=8\\sqrt{27}\\).\nFirst of all, you can use Law 7 to write \\((6x)^3 = 6^3\\cdot x^3\\). Using Law 10, you can then write the left hand side of this equation as \\[\\sqrt{(6x)^3} = \\sqrt{6^3\\cdot x^3} = \\sqrt{6^3}\\cdot \\sqrt{x^3}\\] You can now work on \\(\\sqrt{6^3}\\); using Law 7 and Law 10, you can write \\[\\sqrt{6^3} = \\sqrt{2^3\\cdot 3^3} = \\sqrt{8}\\cdot \\sqrt{27}.\\] Therefore, the initial equation becomes \\[\\sqrt{(6x)^3} = \\sqrt{8}\\cdot \\sqrt{27}\\cdot\\sqrt{x^3}=8\\sqrt{27}.\\] Dividing both sides by \\(\\sqrt{8}\\) (thereby using Laws 2 and 6) and cancelling the \\(\\sqrt{27}\\) gives \\[\\sqrt{x^3} = \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{8}} = \\frac{8^1}{8^{1/2}} = 8^{1/2} = \\sqrt{8}.\\] Squaring both sides to undo the square root gives \\(x^3 = 8\\), and so \\(x = 2\\)."

Using the definition of logarithms, you can express the equation as \\(3x = \\ln(12)\\). Rearranging the equation gives you \\(x=\\dfrac{\\ln(12)}{3}\\) and this is your final answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAlthough \\(e\\) here was treated as some constant, it is actually a very important constant called Euler’s number.\nIn addition, there is a special name for \\(\\log_e(x)\\); this is the natural logarithm of \\(x\\), often written \\(\\ln(x)\\).\nTo see more about Euler’s number \\(e\\) and natural logarithms, please read Guide: Logarithms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\n\nGiven the equation \\(6^x = 3^{x + 1}\\), solve for \\(x\\).\nFirst of all, you can notice that as \\(6\\) is not a power of \\(3\\) (or vice versa) getting these in the same base is difficult. What you can do instead is use the laws of indices to get an expression of the form \\(a^x = b\\) and then take logarithms. Using Law 1, you can write that \\[6^x = 3^x\\cdot 3^1 = 3(3^x)\\] Dividing both sides by \\(3^x\\) and using Law 8 gives \\[\\left(\\frac{6^x}{3^x}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{6}{3}\\right)^x = 3\\] and so you are left with \\(2^x = 3\\). Taking logarithms of both sides to base \\(2\\) gives \\(x = \\log_2(3)\\); and this is your final answer!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 9\n\n\n\nGiven the equation \\(5^{2x} + 7(5^x) - 30 = 0\\), you are asked to solve for \\(x\\).\nStart by letting \\(y = 5^x\\). Then, you can rewrite the equation given as \\((5^x)^2 + 7(5^x) - 30 = 0\\) using Law 3, which is the same as writing \\[y^2 +7y - 30 = 0.\\]\nRecognizing that this is a quadratic equation (see Guide: Introduction to quadratic equations for more), you can use the quadratic formula or otherwise to show that \\[y = -10 \\quad \\textsf{or} \\quad y = 3.\\]\nAs \\(y = 5^x\\), this means that \\(5^x = -10\\) or \\(5^x = 3\\). By taking the logarithm of both sides to base \\(5\\), you can show that \\[x = \\log_5(-10) \\quad \\textsf{or} \\quad x = \\log_5(3).\\] Remember from above that the logarithm of a negative number is not defined, so \\(x = \\log_5(3)\\) is the only viable solution.\n\n\nThe final example uses many of the laws of indices!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 10\n\n\n\nSolve \\(3^{3x} = 5^{x-4}\\).\nThis example is similar to Example 8, only with a few extra steps. Once again, as \\(3\\) is not a power of \\(5\\) or vice versa, the strategy is to write the equation in the form \\(a^x = b\\) and then take logarithms of both sides.\nFirst of all, use Law 1 to write \\(5^{x-4} = 5^x\\cdot 5^{-4}\\) and Law 3 to write \\(3^{3x} = (3^3)^x\\). Since \\(3^3 = 27\\), the equation becomes \\[27^x = 5^x\\cdot 5^{-4}\\] Dividing both sides by \\(5^x\\) gives \\[\\frac{27^x}{5^x} = 5^{-4}\\] Using Law 8 and Law 5, you can write \\[\\left(\\frac{27}{5}\\right)^x = \\frac{1}{5^4} = \\frac{1}{625}\\] Taking logarithms to base \\(27/5\\) on both sides gives \\(x = \\log_{27/5}(1/625)\\), which is your final answer."

This may extend to finding the angle between two vectors or testing to see if two vectors are perpendicular or not. The tool you need for these endeavours is the scalar product.\nThe scalar product also known as the dot product (due to the symbol for the operation) or inner product (as one of the many inner products that exist in linear mathematics), essentially measures how much two vectors are pointing in the same direction. This measure can then be used to find the angle between two vectors.\nAs you might imagine, this is an important tool if you are working with vectors in three dimensional space. The scalar product has many applications in geometry, multivariable calculus, physics, and chemistry.\nThis guide will give both the algebraic and geometric definition of the scalar product, explain certain properties of the operation, show you how to find the angle between two vectors using the scalar product, and bring awareness to special cases that arise, such as being able to determine whether or not two vectors are perpendicular.\nAs with all other introductory guides to vectors (including Guide: Introduction to vectors and Guide: Vector addition and scalar multiplication), the vectors in this guide are exclusively three dimensional."

Because antiderivatives reverse differentiation, it follows that the antiderivative \\(F(x)\\) of \\(\\cos(x)\\) is equal to \\(F(x) = \\sin(x)\\). You can check your answer to see that \\(F'(x) = \\cos(x)\\).\nHowever, \\(F(x) = \\sin(x)\\) is not the only function that differentiates to give \\(\\cos(x)\\). Because the derivative of every constant real number with respect to \\(x\\) is equal to \\(0\\), it follows (for instance) that \\[\\dfrac{\\textrm{d}}{\\textrm{d}x}(\\sin(x) + 19) = \\cos(x) + 0 = \\cos(x).\\] So the antiderivative for \\(\\cos(x)\\) could be equal to \\(\\sin(x) + 19\\) as well. Because the choice of \\(19\\) was random, any real number could take its place, and so \\(\\cos(x)\\) has infinitely many antiderivatives.\nHow can you encapsulate these infinitely in a single answer? The answer is to write \\(F(x) = \\sin(x) + C\\), where the \\(C\\) is any real number. This \\(C\\) is called the constant of integration, and is used to represent the infinitely many possible antiderivatives. Therefore, you can write that \\[\\int\\cos(x) \\,\\textrm{d}x = \\sin(x) + C.\\]\n\n\nLet’s look at this more generally. If \\(F(x)\\) is a function such that \\(F'(x) = f(x)\\), then the indefinite integral (antiderivative) of \\(f(x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is given by \\[\\int f(x) \\,\\textrm{d}x = F(x) + C\\] where \\(C\\), the constant of integration, is any real number.\nIn summary:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen you work out a indefinite integral \\(\\int f(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\), your final answer should be a function plus a constant of integration \\(C\\). This expression represents all the possible antiderivatives of \\(f(x)\\). You should always remember to add a \\(+C\\) at the very end when finding an indefinite integral.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can work out the value of the constant of integration if you have some extra information about \\(x\\) and \\(f(x)\\). This extra information is known as a boundary condition."

    "text": "Phase shift identities\nAs seen in Guide: Trigonometry (degrees), you can use the unit circle to add or subtract an angle to your \\(\\theta\\) and find yourself on another point of the unit circle.\nFor example, suppose that you were to shift the angle by \\(\\pi/2\\) in some direction. Then the distance that was projected on the \\(x\\)-axis is now projected on the \\(y\\)-axis and vice versa. This would lead to a change between \\(\\sin(\\theta)\\) and \\(\\cos(\\theta)\\). These lead to the following properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase shift with \\(\\pi/2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\sin(\\theta\\pm \\pi/2) = \\pm\\cos(\\theta) \\qquad  \\cos(\\theta\\pm\\pi/2) = \\mp\\sin(\\theta)\\] \\[\\sin(\\pi/2-\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta) \\qquad \\cos(\\pi/2-\\theta) = \\sin(\\theta) \\]\n\n\nWhen you move \\(\\pi\\) you get to the opposite side of the unit circle. This would lead to a change of sign as you go on the same distance, on the other side of the axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase shift with \\(\\pi\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\sin(\\theta+\\pi) = \\sin(\\theta-\\pi) = -\\sin(\\theta) \\qquad \\cos(\\theta+\\pi) = \\cos(\\theta-\\pi) = -\\cos(\\theta)\\]\nand so \\[\\tan(\\theta+\\pi) = \\tan(\\theta-\\pi) = \\tan(\\theta)\\]\n\n\nWhen you move \\(2\\pi\\) radians you get back to where you started. Therefore:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase shift with \\(2\\pi\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\sin(\\theta+2\\pi) = \\sin(\\theta) \\qquad \\cos(\\theta+2\\pi) = \\cos(\\theta)\\]\n\n\nFollowing these two results, you can say that \\(\\sin\\) and \\(\\cos\\) are periodic with period \\(2\\pi\\). In fact, for any whole number \\(k\\) (both positive and negative), you can say that\n\\[\\sin(\\theta+2k\\pi) = \\sin(\\theta) \\qquad \\cos(\\theta+2k\\pi) = \\cos(\\theta)\\]\nFor more on this, see guide on [Guide: Multiple revolutions and negative angles]. You can use these equations to work out more trigonometric values:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\n\nUsing the fact that \\(\\cos(\\pi/3) = 1/2\\) and \\(\\sin(\\pi/3) = \\sqrt{3}/2\\), you can work out the values of \\(\\cos(13\\pi/3)\\) and \\(\\sin(-23\\pi/3)\\). Here, you can write \\[\\frac{13\\pi}{3} = \\frac{12\\pi}{3} + \\frac{\\pi}{3} = 4\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\] and so \\[\\cos\\left(\\frac{13\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\cos\\left(4\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}.\\] Similarly \\[-\\frac{23\\pi}{3} = -\\frac{24\\pi}{3} + \\frac{\\pi}{3} = -8\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\] and so \\[\\sin\\left(-\\frac{23\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\sin\\left(-8\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}.\\]"

Work is now being done to replace as many of figures in existing guides as possible.\nHuge thanks to Desmos for providing us with access to their development tools!\n\n\n\nTechnical context\nIn our drive to provide the best, most accessible resources possible, we have been searching for the best way to provide diagrams. At the moment, the diagrams in study guides are static png files produced using TikZ, the inbuilt drawing package in LaTeX. While they look good, they cannot be parsed by screen readers and are liable to scaling issues when moving from computer to phone. Since the inception of the project, STARMAST has looked for better ways to represent mathematical diagrams and boost interactivity of the site.\nInteractive figures powered by Desmos’s development tools solve this issue and then some. We are now able to render complex mathematical ideas in a wholly new and improved way, providing a much wider pedagogical scope than before. In addition to this, these figures come with some accessibility concerns already accounted for – such as being able to display in Braille.\nWork is now being done to replace as many of the old png files in the existing guides as possible, certainly on the website version of the resources. The png files will still need to be maintained in the pdf and docx versions of the resources.\n\n\nVersion history\n\nv1.0 initial version written by tdhc 04/12/24."

    "text": "Another bumper summer update at STARMAST today, with no fewer than 24 new written resources and the addition of 2D and 3D graphical calculators! 💫\nLots to say, so let’s get straight into it…\n\n\n\n\nThe first topic is on an introduction to partial differentiation and is written by Donald Campbell, a fourth-year participant in the University of St Andrews VIP project in Semester 2 2024/25. This guide covers aspects of partial differentiation including initial concepts, how to find partial derivatives and higher partial derivatives. This guide contains our first ever 3D Desmos interactive figures.\nThe links to the guide, questions and answers can be found here:\n\nGuide: Introduction to partial differentiation\nQuestions: Introduction to partial differentiation\nAnswers: Introduction to partial differentiation\n\nA big thank you to Donald for writing these guides and resources!\n\n\n\nDonald has also been busy writing literally hundreds of integration questions. A selection of these can be found in our new introduction to integration guide, written by editor-in-chief Tom. This guide introduces the ideas of both definite and indefinite integration, and explains the role of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus in connecting the two. All of the relevant links can be found here:\n\nGuide: Introduction to integration\nQuestions: Introduction to integration\nAnswers: Introduction to integration\n\n\n\n\nFinally, editor-in-chief Tom has written a guide providing an introduction to expected value, variance and standard deviations for random variables. All of the relevant links can be found here:\n\nGuide: Expected value, variance, standard deviation\nQuestions: Expected value, variance, standard deviation\nAnswers: Expected value, variance, standard deviation\n\n\n\n\n\nOur next guide expands our statistics provision and covers main aspects of probability distributions. This includes overviews of fourteen of the most common probability distributions, including interactive calculators for each of them written in R Shiny. This (online-only) overview has been written by Michelle Arnetta, a first-year participant in the University of St Andrews VIP project in Semester 2 2024/25.\n\nOverview: Probability distributions\n\nFor your convenience however, we here at STARMAST have split up this document and created factsheets for every one of the fourteen distributions. These factsheets contain an interactive calculator for that distribution, as well as all of the information from the overview and an example of where you could use the distribution. These factsheets replace the calculators for the probability distributions added in May (click to see the news article from May 2025 here) and can be found here:\n\nFactsheet: Beta distribution\nFactsheet: Binomial distribution\nFactsheet: Chi-squared distribution\nFactsheet: Continuous uniform distribution\nFactsheet: Discrete uniform distribution\nFactsheet: Exponential distribution\nFactsheet: \\(F\\)-distribution\nFactsheet: Gamma distribution\nFactsheet: Geometric distribution\nFactsheet: Lognormal distribution\nFactsheet: Negative binomial distribution\nFactsheet: Normal distribution\nFactsheet: Poisson distribution\nFactsheet: \\(t\\)-distribution\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the introduction of the new 3D Desmos capability in Guide: Introduction to partial differentiation, we have provided both a 2D and 3D graphical calculator on the site for your endless amusement.

You calculate the expected frequencies of each outcome. Then you roll the die many times and record the observed frequencies of each outcome. Since there are 6 categories, \\[\\textsf{degrees of freedom = number of categories} - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5\\] This can be expressed as \\(X \\sim \\chi^2(5)\\), meaning the degrees of freedom is \\(5\\).\nTest for independence example: You are investigating whether there is a correlation between two variables: candy colour and flavour. You have \\(5\\) categories of colours and 3 categories of flavours. Calculating the degrees of freedom can be done with the formula: \\[(\\textsf{categories of colours} - 1)(\\textsf{categories of flavours} - 1) = (5-1)(3-1)=(4)(2)=8.\\] You can model \\(X \\sim \\chi^2(8)\\), meaning that there are \\(8\\) degrees of freedom."

You have to force the issue slightly by creatively adding \\(0\\); in this case, by adding \\(-f(x)g(x) + f(x)g(x) = 0\\) to the numerator. In addition, you can use properties of limits to get rid of the \\(g(x)g(x+h)\\) in the denominator. Doing these steps and simplifying gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(\\frac{f}{g}\\right)'(x) &= \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(x+h)g(x) - f(x)g(x+h)}{hg(x)g(x+h)}\\\\[0.5em]\n&= \\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(x+h)g(x) - f(x)g(x+h)}{h}\\right)\\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{1}{g(x)g(x+h)}\\right)\\\\[0.5em]\n&= \\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(x+h)g(x) - f(x)g(x) + f(x)g(x) - f(x)g(x+h)}{h}\\right)\\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{1}{g(x)g(x+h)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNow, factorizing this expression, using the properties of limits) and moving \\(g(x)\\) and \\(-f(x)\\) (notice that this needs to be done to ensure the correct definition of the derivative) out of the limits where appropriate gives \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(\\tfrac{f}{g}\\right)'(x) &= \\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\tfrac{f(x+h)g(x) - f(x)g(x) + f(x)g(x) - f(x)g(x+h)}{h}\\right)\\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\tfrac{1}{g(x)g(x+h)}\\right)\\\\[0.5em]\n&= \\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\tfrac{g(x)(f(x+h) - f(x))- f(x)(g(x+h)-g(x))}{h}\\right)\\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\tfrac{1}{g(x)g(x+h)}\\right)\\\\[0.5em]\n&= \\left(\\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\tfrac{g(x)(f(x+h) - f(x))}{h}\\right) + \\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\tfrac{-f(x)(g(x+h) -g(x))}{h}\\right)\\right)\\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\tfrac{1}{g(x)g(x+h)}\\right)\\\\[0.5em]\n&= \\left(g(x)\\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\tfrac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\\right) - f(x)\\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\tfrac{g(x+h) -g(x)}{h}\\right)\\right)\\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\tfrac{1}{g(x)g(x+h)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Now, as \\(h\\) tends to \\(0\\), it follows that \\(g(x+h)\\) tends to \\(g(x)\\), implying that the final limit tends to \\(1/(g(x))^2\\).

The idea is to take the limit definition of \\((f\\circ g)'(x)\\) and split the limit into the product of the two derivatives \\(f'(g(x))\\) and \\(g'(x)\\). It requires more thought than the proofs of the product and chain rule, primarily due to the reliance on definitions of differentiation and the fact that it isn’t a creative addition of \\(0\\) that splits the derivative, but a creative multiplication by \\(1\\) instead.\n\nAlternative definition of derivative\nProving the chain rule requires the restatement of the limit definition of a derivative at a point \\(a\\). Here are the two definitions side by side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimit definition of the derivative (1)\n\n\n\nThe derivative of \\(f(x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\) at the point \\(a\\) is defined to be \\[f'(a) = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}.\\]\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimit definition of the derivative (2)\n\n\n\nThe derivative of \\(f(x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\) at the point \\(a\\) is defined to be \\[f'(a) = \\lim_{x\\to a}\\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x-a}.\\]\n\n\n(See [Guide: Introduction to differentiability] for more.) To see that these are equal, start with definition (1). Here, \\(h\\) is the variable as the limit depends on \\(h\\). Now, rescale the limit by setting \\(h = x - a\\) (see [Guide: Properties of limits] for more). This gives\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nf'(a) &= \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}\\\\[0.5em]\n&= \\lim_{x-a\\to 0}\\frac{f(a+(x-a)) - f(a)}{x-a}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] As \\(x - a \\to 0\\), it follows that \\(x\\to a\\); in addition, \\(a + (x-a) = x\\). So the limit becomes \\[f'(a) = \\lim_{x-a\\to 0}\\frac{f(a+(x-a)) - f(a)}{x-a} = \\lim_{x\\to a}\\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x-a}\\] so the definitions are the same at a point. Since a function \\(f\\) is differentiable on an interval \\(I\\) of real numbers if and only if \\(f'(a)\\) exists for all \\(a\\) in \\(I\\), it follows that you can use this definition for a differentiable function.\n\n\nIntuition\nThe idea is to start with the second limit definition of the derivative above and put the function \\((f\\circ g)(x) = f(g(x))\\) into the definition to get: \\[(f\\circ g)'(a) = \\lim_{x\\to a}\\frac{f(g(x)) - f(g(a))}{x-a}.\\]\nNow, you would want to generate the derivative of \\(f\\) with respect to \\(g(x)\\) at \\(a\\) and the derivative of \\(g\\) with respect to \\(x\\) at \\(a\\). To do this, you can notice that the \\(x-a\\) is already there for the derivative of \\(g\\). You can multiply top and bottom of the fraction by \\(g(x) - g(a)\\). Since \\(\\frac{(g(x) - g(a))}{(g(x) - g(a))} = 1\\), this does not change the value of the limit. This gives \\[(f\\circ g)'(a) = \\lim_{x\\to a}\\left(\\frac{f(g(x)) - f(g(a))}{x-a}\\cdot \\frac{(g(x) - g(a))}{(g(x) - g(a))}\\right).\\] You can now pull this limit apart to attempt to make the two definitions of \\(f'(g(a))\\) and \\(g'(a)\\). Using the properties of limits to do this gives \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n(f\\circ g)'(a) &= \\lim_{x\\to a}\\left(\\frac{f(g(x)) - f(g(a))}{x-a}\\cdot \\frac{(g(x) - g(a))}{(g(x) - g(a))}\\right)\\\\[0.5em]\n&= \\lim_{x\\to a}\\frac{f(g(x)) - f(g(a))}{g(x)-g(a)}\\cdot \\lim_{x\\to a}\\frac{(g(x) - g(a))}{x-a}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] The second of these terms is \\(g'(a)\\), which is what you want. The first of these terms would be the definition of \\(f'(g(a))\\)… if the limit was \\(g(x)\\to g(a)\\) rather than \\(x\\to a\\). Here is the problem, because you cannot guarantee the behaviour of \\(g(x) - g(a)\\) as \\(x\\) gets closer to \\(a\\); it could be that \\(g(x) - g(a) = 0\\), which is a big problem. In fact, it could be that as \\(x\\) gets closer to \\(a\\), then \\(g(x) - g(a)\\) could be \\(0\\) in infinitely many different places. This needs to be rectified.\n\n\nOvercoming the technicality\nThe idea is to ‘fill in’ the places where \\(g(x) - g(a) = 0\\), by defining the value of the function \\(\\frac{f(g(x)) - f(g(a))}{g(x)-g(a)}\\) at these points. You can define the function \\[\\phi(y) = \\begin{cases} \\dfrac{f(y) - f(g(a))}{y-g(a)} & \\textsf{ if }y\\neq g(a)\\\\[0.5em] f'(g(a)) & \\textsf{ if }y=g(a)\\end{cases}\\] You can notice here that \\(f'(g(a))\\) is already defined as \\(f\\) is a differentiable function, meaning that \\(f'(y)\\) exists for all \\(y\\).\nNow, consider the expression \\[\\phi(g(x))\\cdot \\frac{(g(x) - g(a))}{x-a}.\\] The idea is to prove that \\[\\dfrac{f(g(x)) - f(g(a))}{x-a} = \\phi(g(x))\\cdot \\frac{(g(x) - g(a))}{x-a}\\] for all \\(x\\). This way, you can evaluate the limit of the right hand side instead of the left hand side. However, this does depend on whether or not \\(g(x) = g(a)\\).\n\nIf \\(g(x)\\neq g(a)\\), then \\(g(x) - g(a) \\neq 0\\). You can use the first part of the definition to say that \\[\\phi(g(x))\\cdot \\frac{(g(x) - g(a))}{x-a} = \\dfrac{f(g(x)) - f(g(a))}{g(x)-g(a)}\\cdot \\frac{(g(x) - g(a))}{x-a}\\] Since \\(g(x) - g(a) \\neq 0\\), you can cancel these to get \\[\\phi(g(x))\\cdot \\frac{(g(x) - g(a))}{x-a} = \\dfrac{f(g(x)) - f(g(a))}{x-a}.\\]\nIf \\(g(x) = g(a)\\) then \\(g(x) - g(a) = 0\\) and also \\(f(g(x)) - f(g(a)) = 0\\). This implies that \\[\\phi(g(x))\\cdot \\frac{(g(x) - g(a))}{x-a} = \\phi(g(x))\\cdot 0 = 0.\\]\n\nSo they really are equal. Using this expression, together with the properties of limits gives \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n(f\\circ g)'(a) &= \\left(\\frac{f(g(x)) - f(g(a))}{x-a}\\right)\\\\[0.5em]\n&= \\lim_{x\\to a}\\phi\\left(g(x)\\right)\\cdot \\lim_{x\\to a}\\frac{g(x) - g(a)}{x-a}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] The idea is then to prove that these two limits exist; as then \\((f\\circ g)'(a)\\) would exist. The second of these limits is precisely the definition of \\(g'(a)\\), so let’s focus on the limit of \\(\\phi(g(x))\\) as \\(x\\) tends to \\(a\\). If this function \\(\\phi \\circ g\\) is continuous at \\(a\\) (see [Guide: Introduction to continuity]) then this limit exists and is equal to \\(\\phi(g(a))\\). The function \\(\\phi\\) is defined whenever \\(f\\) is. Since \\(f\\) is differentiable, then it is continuous at every point, including \\(g(a)\\); therefore, \\(\\phi\\) is continuous at \\(g(a)\\). Since \\(g\\) is differentiable at \\(a\\), then \\(g\\) is continuous at \\(a\\). Therefore, by properties of continuous functions (see [Guide: Introduction to continuity]), \\(\\phi\\circ g\\) is continuous at \\(a\\). It follows that \\[\\lim_{x\\to a}\\phi\\left(g(x)\\right) = \\phi(g(a)) = f'(g(a))\\] by definition and so\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n(f\\circ g)'(a) &= \\lim_{x\\to a}\\phi\\left(g(x)\\right)\\cdot \\lim_{x\\to a}\\frac{g(x) - g(a)}{x-a}\\\\[0.5em]\n&= f'(g(a))\\cdot g'(a)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nand this is the chain rule!"
