    "text": "Before reading this proof sheet, it is essential that you read Guide: Introduction to differentiation and the derivative. In addition, reading [Guide: Introduction to limits] is useful. Further reading will be illustrated where required.\nThe starting point of this proof sheet is the limit definition of the derivative of a function:\nTo find the derivative of a function \\(f(x)\\), replace the function \\(f\\) in the right-hand side of the above limit, and then evaluate the limit. Care has to be taken to remove the \\(h\\) in the denominator of the fraction, as you cannot evaluate the limit as \\(h\\) tends to \\(0\\) with it still there! (Remember, dividing by \\(0\\) can be extremely hazardous to your health.)\nFrom here, the proof sheet will start with the proof of the derivative of \\(x^2\\), which will then be expanded using the binomial theorem to find the derivative of \\(x^n\\). Then, the derivative of \\(e^x\\) is found. Finally, the derivatives of \\(\\sin(x)\\) and \\(\\cos(x)\\) are demonstrated."

Taking square roots of both sides (not forgetting that it could be positive or negative) gives \\[x + \\frac{b}{2a} = \\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\] and rearranging gives \\[x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\] as required."

You calculate the expected frequencies of each outcome. Then you roll the die many times and record the observed frequencies of each outcome. Since there are 6 categories, \\[\\textsf{degrees of freedom = number of categories} - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5\\] This can be expressed as \\(X \\sim \\chi^2(5)\\), meaning the degrees of freedom is \\(5\\).\nTest for independence example: You are investigating whether there is a correlation between two variables: candy colour and flavour. You have \\(5\\) categories of colours and 3 categories of flavours. Calculating the degrees of freedom can be done with the formula: \\[(\\textsf{categories of colours} - 1)(\\textsf{categories of flavours} - 1) = (5-1)(3-1)=(4)(2)=8.\\] You can model \\(X \\sim \\chi^2(8)\\), meaning that there are \\(8\\) degrees of freedom."

    "text": "Multiplication and division\nThe reason why you can undo multiplication with division (and division with multiplication) is that any number multiplied by \\(1\\) is itself. However, the following health warning applies:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nMost of the time, you can undo multiplication in an equation by division. The only time you are not able to do this is if you divide by \\(0\\); which is strictly forbidden in mathematics and carries a heavy punishment. The expression \\(0/0\\) is undefined and should not be written.\n\n\nThe example below uses division to ‘undo’ the multiplication in the equation in \\(x\\). As with Example 1, this example uses more detail than is necessary to illustrate the concepts involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample 3\n\n\n\nGiven the equation \\(8x = 9\\), you can make \\(x\\) the subject by dividing both sides by \\(8\\) (which is not equal to \\(0\\)). Doing this gives\n\\[\\frac{8x}{8} = \\frac{9}{8}\\]\nThis can then be simplified. As \\(\\dfrac{8}{8}\\) is equal to 1, the expression simplifies to \\[1\\cdot x = \\frac{8}{9}\\]\nwhich, as \\(1\\cdot x = 1\\) for all numbers \\(x\\), can be simplified to\n\\[x = \\frac{8}{9}\\] and since \\(x\\) is on its own on the left-hand side, you are finished.\n\n\nSimilarly, you can undo division in an equation by using multiplication. Since no equation will ever be divided by \\(0\\) to begin with, you can always undo division.\nThis next example combines what you have learned so far.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample 4\n\n\n\nHow do you make \\(x\\) the subject of the equation \\(\\dfrac{3}{4}x + a = 6\\)?\nIn fact, you have a little bit of flexibility in this question. One way you can do it is isolate a multiple of \\(x\\) on one side by subtracting by \\(a\\) first. Doing this gives \\[\\frac{3}{4}x = 6 - a\\] You know that you can undo the division of \\(x\\) by \\(4\\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \\(4\\). Here, that you have to multiply all of the right hand side by \\(4\\); this includes both terms \\(6\\) and \\(-a\\). This is an important step; as if you don’t do this, you are violating the golden rule in not treating both sides of the equation exactly the same! To make sure you do not fall into this trap, it can be useful to use brackets to ensure everything on the right-hand side is multiplied by \\(4\\). Anyway, the next step in the rearranging is \\[3x = 4(6-a)\\] Now, dividing both sides by \\(3\\) (making sure to divide everything on the right-hand side by \\(3\\)) gives \\[x = \\frac{4(6-a)}{3}\\] and you are done.\n\n\nThere are many ways to do this question. You could do the division by \\(3\\) first, then the subtraction by \\(a/3\\), then the multiplication by \\(4\\). Here, the order of operations doesn’t matter so much, but isolating a multiple of the chosen variable on one side is often the best way to go about rearranging equations.\nThis forms the basis of the general strategy for rearranging any equation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen rearranging an equation for a variable, try to get exactly one term involving that variable on one side of the equation; then do what you need to do to isolate that variable.\n\n\nIt is also worth restating:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen multiplying/dividing one side of an equation by a number \\(a\\), make sure to multiply/divide everything on that side of an equation by \\(a\\).\n\n\nThis is a common health warning in rearranging equations, as you will see throughout the rest of the guide."

    "text": "Powers and roots\n\nUndoing powers of \\(n\\) using \\(n\\)th roots\nHow would you undo a power such as \\(x^2 = 9\\), \\(y^3 = 64\\) or even \\(x^n = a\\) (where \\(n\\geq 2\\) is a whole number)?\nThe idea is to use roots. However, there are some considerations to be made when taking the \\(n\\)th root of an equation.\nTake the first of these examples, which is \\(x^2 = 9\\). Here, you are trying to rearrange for \\(x\\), where \\(x\\) is some number than when squared gives \\(9\\). You would immediately think that \\(x = 3\\), and you’d be right; but \\(x\\) could also be \\(-3\\). How do you account for this? The idea is to use the square root symbol \\(\\sqrt{\\;}\\), but \\(x = \\sqrt{9}\\) can’t be two solutions at once. To get around this, you could define the square root symbol to always mean the positive square root of a number, and write \\(\\pm\\) to mean ‘plus or minus’. Therefore, if \\(x^2=9\\), then \\(x = \\pm \\sqrt{9} = \\pm 3\\) to rearrange for \\(x\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe square root of a negative number is not a real number. If you want to rearrange an equation like \\(x^2 = -4\\) for \\(x\\), then you will need to use complex numbers. See Guide: Introduction to complex numbers for more.\nComplex numbers are not considered in the rest of this guide.\n\n\nSo, what about \\(y^3 = 64\\)? Here there is only one number that when cubed is equal to \\(64\\); this number is \\(4\\). This is because \\((-4)^3 = -64\\). So in fact, you are able to take the cube root \\(\\sqrt[3]{\\;}\\) of any number and not have to worry about signs; if \\(y^3 = 64\\) then \\(y = \\sqrt[3]{64} = 4\\). You can contrast this to the case of the square roots!\nNow, what about \\(x^n = a\\)? If \\(n\\) is even, then \\(x^n\\) must be a square number, and so must be positive. In addition, if \\(n\\) is even then \\((-x)^n = x^n\\), and so you must also take positive and negative roots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteUndoing powers using \\(n\\)th roots\n\n\n\nSuppose that \\(x^n = a\\).\n\nIf \\(n\\) is even and \\(a \\geq 0\\), then \\[x = \\pm\\sqrt[n]{a}\\] where \\(\\sqrt[n]{a}\\) is the positive \\(n\\)th root of \\(a\\).\nIf \\(n\\) is odd, then \\[x = \\sqrt[n]{a}\\] where \\(\\sqrt[n]{a}\\) is the \\(n\\)th root of \\(a\\).\n\n\n\nThankfully, the situation of undoing \\(n\\)th roots using powers of \\(n\\) is not as complex (no pun intended!). Since there is no ambiguity about the sign of an \\(n\\)th root, you can raise to the power of \\(n\\) to undo the root in any case:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteUndoing \\(n\\)th roots using powers of \\(n\\)\n\n\n\nSuppose that \\(\\sqrt[n]{x} = a\\). Then \\(x = a^n\\).\n\n\nWhen rearranging equations involving powers of \\(n\\) and \\(n\\)th roots, you should always aim to isolate your variable on one side before undoing the power of \\(n\\) or the \\(n\\)th root. This is because:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIn general, \\[a^n + b^n \\neq (a+b)^n \\quad\\textsf{ and }\\quad\\sqrt[n]{a} + \\sqrt[n]{b} \\neq \\sqrt[n]{a+b}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample 5\n\n\n\nYou are given the equation \\(2z = 4x^2 + 5y\\). To make \\(x\\) the subject of this equation, you should isolate \\(4x^2\\) on one side of the equation like so:\n\\[4x^2 = 5y − 2z\\] Now, to apply the square root, you need to have \\(x^2\\) on its own. So divide by \\(4\\) to get\n\\[x^2 = \\frac{5y-2z}{4}\\] Now you can then take the square root of both sides to get\n\\[x = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{5y − 2z}{4}}\\] and this is your answer.\n\n\nFor roots in equations, you can use inverse operation of taking the equation to a power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample 6\n\n\n\nIf you want to make \\(x\\) the subject of the equation \\(\\displaystyle \\sqrt[5]{\\frac{x^3}{2}} = b-1\\), you need to undo the fifth root around \\(x^3/2\\). This can be done by raising both sides to the power of \\(5\\). Following the health warning above, you must remember to raise everything on the right hand side to the power of \\(5\\). Doing this gives \\[\\frac{x^3}{2} = (b-1)^5\\] You cannot take cube roots yet however, because of that \\(2\\). Multiplying \\(2\\) from both sides gives \\[x^3 = 2(b-1)^5.\\] Now you can cube root to get \\[x = \\sqrt[3]{2(b-1)^5}\\] and you are done.\n\n\nFinally, let’s return to the initial example at the start of the guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample 7\n\n\n\nLet’s take \\[5x^3y^3 + \\frac{6z}{w^4} = 4abc^2\\] How do you rearrange for \\(x\\)?\nFirst of all, you need to isolate the term involving \\(x\\) on one side of the equation. You can subtract \\(6z/w^4\\) from both sides of the equation to get \\[5x^3y^3 = 4abc^2 - \\frac{6z}{w^4}\\] You now need to get a power of \\(x\\) on its own by dividing through by \\(5\\) and \\(y^3\\). You can either do these separately or together. So dividing both sides of the equation by \\(5y^3\\) gives \\[x^3 = \\frac{4abc^2}{5y^3} - \\frac{6z}{5w^4y^3}\\] Now, taking the cube root of both sides gives \\[x = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{4abc^2}{5y^3} - \\frac{6z}{5w^4y^3}}\\] and this is your answer."

See Figure Figure 1 for a picture of this process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Graphical representation of vector addition. The three steps of the process are labelled.\n\n\n\nWhat does this mean for a vector written in \\(\\mathbf{i},\\mathbf{j},\\mathbf{k}\\) notation? Examining the \\(\\mathbf{i}\\) component of the vector \\(\\mathbf{u}+\\mathbf{v}\\), you can notice that you first move using \\(\\mathbf{i}\\) component of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and then move by the \\(\\mathbf{i}\\) component of \\(\\mathbf{v}\\). It follows that the \\(\\mathbf{i}\\) component of the vector \\(\\mathbf{u}+\\mathbf{v}\\) is the sum of the \\(\\mathbf{i}\\) component of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{i}\\) component of \\(\\mathbf{v}\\).

Scalar multiplying a vector by a positive scalar typically changes the magnitude of the vector and preserves the direction, and multiplying a vector by a negative scalar typically changes the magnitude of the vector and reverses the direction. Figure 3 shows a picture of these scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Graphical representation of scalar multiplication.\n\n\n\nWhat does scalar multiplication do to the components of a vector? Suppose that you are scalar multiplying the vector \\(\\mathbf{i}\\). This is a unit vector, so has magnitude \\(1\\). Since scalar multiplication by a scalar \\(\\lambda\\) (pronounced ‘lambda’) changes the length of a vector, it follows that the vector \\(\\lambda\\mathbf{i}\\) has magnitude \\(|\\lambda|\\), the absolute value of \\(\\lambda\\).\nSince every vector \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) is the sum of scalar multiples of \\(\\mathbf{i},\\mathbf{j},\\mathbf{k}\\), it follows that \\(\\lambda\\mathbf{u}\\) is the sum of scalar multiples of \\(\\lambda\\mathbf{i},\\lambda\\mathbf{j},\\lambda\\mathbf{k}\\).

This requires an excellent knowledge of solving simultaneous equations; see Guide: Introduction to solving simultaneous equations for more.\nSolving vector equations is best done when following the lead of examples; here are two.

Using the definition of vector addition, you can write that \\[\\overrightarrow{OB} = \\overrightarrow{OA} + \\overrightarrow{AB}\\] and so \\(\\overrightarrow{OA} = \\overrightarrow{OB} - \\overrightarrow{AB}\\).

It is important that you take these two scalars to be potentially different, so give them different names like \\(\\lambda\\) (‘lambda’) and \\(\\mu\\) (‘mu’). So \\[7\\mathbf{i} + 19 \\mathbf{j} = \\lambda \\mathbf{u} + \\mu \\mathbf{v}\\] Since \\(\\mathbf{u} = 4\\mathbf{i} + 3\\mathbf{j}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v} = -\\mathbf{i} + 2\\mathbf{j}\\), this becomes \\[7\\mathbf{i} + 19 \\mathbf{j} = (4\\lambda \\mathbf{i} + 3\\lambda\\mathbf{j}) + (-\\mu\\mathbf{i} + 2\\mu\\mathbf{j})\\] These two vectors are equal if and only if their components are equal.

Taking \\(f(x) = x^3\\), you can see that this is equal to the derivative \\(f'(x) = 3x^2\\) multiplied by \\(e^{f(x)}\\).

In fact, this is another case of \\(x^n\\); in this case, \\(n = 1/2\\). (See Guide: Laws of indices for why this is.)\nYou can then rewrite the function as \\[f(x) = 4e^{3x} - x^{1/2}\\] which you can then apply your knowledge of differentiation to. Using the results above, the derivative of \\(4e^{3x}\\) is \\(4\\cdot3\\cdot e^{3x} = 12e^{3x}\\). The derivative of \\(x^{1/2}\\) is \\(\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2}\\right)x^{1/2 - 1} = \\dfrac{x^{-1/2}}{2}\\). Therefore, the derivative of \\(4e^{3x} - \\sqrt{x}\\) is \\[f'(x) = 12e^{3x} - \\frac{x^{-1/2}}{2}\\]\nYou could turn \\(x^{-1/2}\\) into \\(1/\\sqrt{x}\\); however, you may be asked to differentiate this function again (particularly if you are looking into behaviour of a function), and often it is best to leave the power as a real number rather than using the square root notation.\n\n\nAs a rule of thumb, you should always write an \\(n\\)th root using a fractional power instead. Here’s another example of where you should write a term involving a power of \\(x\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample 3\n\n\n\nFind the derivative of the function \\(f(t) = \\dfrac{1}{t^4} + 4\\cos(t) - \\sin(4t)\\) with respect to \\(t\\).\nAgain, the cosine and sine terms are manageable from the derivative above, it is only the \\(1/t^4\\) term that needs a little thought. In fact, this is yet another case of \\(t^n\\); this time when \\(n = -4\\). (See Guide: Laws of indices for why this is.)\nYou can then rewrite the function as \\[f(t) = t^{-4} + 4\\sin(t) - \\cos(4t)\\] and use the familiar rules of differentiation above. Using the results above with \\(n = -4\\), the derivative of \\(t^{-4}\\) is \\(-4t^{-4-1} = -4t^{-5}\\). The derivative of \\(4\\sin(t)\\) is \\(4(\\cos(t)) = 4\\cos(t)\\). The derivative of \\(\\cos(4t)\\) is \\(-4\\sin(4t)\\). Taking care of your signs you can write the derivative of \\(\\dfrac{1}{t^4} + 4\\cos(t) - \\sin(4t)\\) as \\[f'(t) = -4t^{-5} + 4\\cos(t) - (-4\\sin(4t)) = -4t^{-5} + 4\\cos(t) + 4\\sin(4t).\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample 4\n\n\n\nDetermine the behaviour of the function \\(f(x) = 2\\ln(3x) - x\\) when \\(x = 1\\).\nHere, you will first need to differentiate the function \\(f(x)\\) to find \\(f'(x)\\). Then, you will need to evaluate the derivative \\(f'(x)\\) when \\(x = 1\\) to see how the function behaves.\nUsing your rules of differentiation as you found above, you can say that the derivative of \\(2\\ln(3x)\\) is \\(2/x\\), and the derivative of \\(x\\) is \\(1\\). Therefore, the derivative of the function \\(f(x) = 2\\ln(3x) - x\\) is \\[f'(x) = \\frac{2}{x} - 1.\\] You can evaluate the derivative \\(f'(x)\\) at \\(x = 1\\) to get \\[f'(1) = \\frac{2}{1} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1\\] and so the derivative is positive at \\(x = 1\\). This implies that the function \\(f(x) = 2\\ln(3x) - x\\) is increasing at the point \\(x = 1\\).\nIt also means that the gradient of the tangent to the function \\(f(x)\\) at the point \\((1,2\\ln(3) - 1)\\) is \\(1\\). You can see this in the figure below."

If you can do this, then you can rewrite the expression as \\[x^2 + bx + c = x^2+(d+e)x+de.\\] You can expand the brackets to see that \\[x^2+(d+e)x+de = x^2+dx+ex+de.\\] \\(x\\) is a common factor of the first two terms, and \\(e\\) is a common factor of the second two terms, you can factorize using the techniques above to get \\[x^2+dx+ex+de = x(x+d) + e(x+d)\\] Since \\((x+d)\\) is a common factor of both of the terms \\(x(x+d)\\) and \\(e(x+d)\\), you can factorize again to get \\[x^2 + bx + c = x(x+d) + e(x+d) = (x+d)(x+e).\\]\nThis is the desired form of the quadratic expression!

You want to look at the factors and see which pairings multiply to make \\(-2\\) and add to \\(1\\). These are: \\[2 \\cdot (-1)=-2\\quad \\textsf{and} \\quad 2+(-1)=1.\\]\nSo \\(2\\) and \\(-1\\) are the correct factors to use.\nNow, put them into the brackets in a similar fashion to Example 9, to give the final factorized form: \\[x^2+x-1=(x+2)(x-1).\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe order of the factors don’t matter, but the signs do!\nExample 11 is an example of this - if the signs of the factors were swapped, it would result in a different quadratic to the one you have been asked to factorize. If you swapped the signs, you would get \\((x-2)(x+1)\\). When expanded, this gives: \\[(x-2)(x+1) = x^2 -2x +x -2\\] \\[ = x^2 -x -2\\] \\[x^2 -x -2 \\neq x^2+x-2.\\]\n\\(x^2 -x -2\\) is not the original quadratic expression you were asked to factorize, which shows you how if a factor has the incorrect sign, the required quadratic expression will not be factorized correctly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf \\(c=0\\), you can factorize the quadratic expression using the common factor \\(x\\). This is because if \\(c=0\\), then: \\[ax^2 +bx +c = ax^2 + bx.\\] Which can then be factorized as: \\[ax^2 + bx = x(ax + b).\\] If \\(a=1\\), this is still true, and is factorized as: \\[x^2 + bx = x(x + b).\\]\nExample 7 is an example where \\(a \\neq 0\\) and \\(c=0\\)."

So if you rewrite the expression, it becomes: \\[ax^2+bx+c= ax^2+dx + ex+c.\\] You can now group the expression: \\[ax^2+dx + ex+c = (ax^2+dx) + (ex+c).\\] Factorizing each bracket gives: \\[\\left( ax^2 + dx \\right) + \\left( ex+c \\right) = a x \\left( x+\\dfrac{d}{a} \\right) + e \\left( x+\\dfrac{c}{e} \\right).\\] Since \\(d \\cdot e = a \\cdot c\\) from the start of your working, dividing both sides by \\(ae\\) gives \\(\\dfrac{d}{a}=\\dfrac{c}{e}\\). You can define this as a value \\(f\\), where \\(f=\\dfrac{d}{a}=\\dfrac{c}{e}\\), and substitute this in to give: \\[(ax^2+dx) + (ex+c) = ax(x+f) + e(x + f).\\] This means that both groups will share the common factor \\((x+f)\\), and the expression can be factorized further to give: \\[(ax^2+dx) + (ex+c) = (ax+e)(x+f).\\] This is the fully factorized form of the quadratic expression \\(ax^2+bx+c\\) when \\(a \\neq 1\\).\nThese are the steps to factorize a quadratic of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\):\n\nMultiply \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) together.\nFind two numbers that multiply to give \\(a \\cdot c\\), and add to give \\(b\\).\nRewrite the middle term using these two numbers.\nFactorize by grouping as above.\n\nYou can see that this method extends Case 1 (where \\(a = 1\\)). If \\(a=1\\), then in this case \\(a\\cdot c = c\\) and this method then reduces to the above. Let’s see an example\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample 12\n\n\n\nFactorize \\(2x^2+5x+3\\).\nYou can follow the steps above.\n\nFirst, you need to multiply \\(2\\) and \\(3\\) together: \\(2 \\cdot 3=6.\\)\nNow you need to consider all the factors of \\(6\\), which are \\(1,2,3,\\) and \\(6\\). You want to look at the factors and see which pairings multiply to make \\(6\\), and add to \\(5\\). These are: \\[2+3=5\\quad \\textsf{and} \\quad 2\\cdot 3=6.\\]\nNow you can rewrite the original expression, but this time splitting the middle (\\(bx\\)) term into the two factors you found earlier: \\[2x^2+5x+3= 2x^2+2x+3x+3.\\]\nIf you now look at the expression in two halves, there is a common factor for each half, and you can factorize by grouping:\n\n\\[2x^2+5x+3= 2x^2+2x+3x+3= 2x(x+1)+3(x+1).\\] Now, this is similar to the type of factorizing you did in single bracket factorization!\nYou can now take out the the \\((x+1)\\) common factor, to give the result: \\[2x(x+1)+3(x+1)=(2x+3)(x+1).\\] And this gives you your final factorized answer: \\[2x^2+5x+3=(2x+3)(x+1).\\]\n\n\nYou don’t have to use the steps prescriptively in every example; it was only for instructive purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample 13\n\n\n\nFactorize \\(3x^2-2x-5\\).\nYou need to multiply \\(3\\) and \\(-5\\) together: \\[3 \\cdot (-5)=-15.\\]\nYou need to find the factors of \\(-15\\) that multiply to give \\(-15\\), and add to give \\(-2\\). These are: \\[3 + (-5) =-2\\quad \\textsf{and} \\quad 3 \\cdot (-5)=-15.\\]\nNow you can rewrite the original expression, but this time splitting the middle (\\(bx\\)) term into the two factors you found earlier: \\[3x^2-2x-5= 3x^2+3x-5x-5.\\]\nIf you look at the expression in two halves, there is a common factor for each half, and you can factorize by grouping: \\[3x^2-2x-5= 3x^2+3x-5x-5= 3x(x+1)-5(x+1).\\]\nYou can now remove the \\((x+1)\\) common factor, to give the result: \\[3x(x+1)-5(x+1)=(3x-5)(x+1).\\]\nAnd you can write your final factorized answer: \\[3x^2-2x-5=(3x+5)(x+1).\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nNote that a quadratic \\(ax^2+bx+c\\) can sometimes be factorized in the form: \\[(px+q)(rx+s)\\quad \\textsf{where} \\quad p,r \\neq 0.\\]\nHowever, if you factorize out \\(r\\) from each term you get:\n\\[\\left( px+q \\right)\\left( rx+s \\right) = \\dfrac{1}{r^2} \\left( \\left( \\dfrac{px}{r} + \\dfrac{q}{r} \\right) \\left( x+\\dfrac{s}{r} \\right) \\right).\\]\nThis matches the factorized result of \\(ax^2+bx+c\\), so a factorization like \\((px+q)(rx+s)\\) can be expressed using rational numbers to match any desired form. This can be seen as: \\[\\left( \\dfrac{px}{r} + \\dfrac{q}{r} \\right) \\left( x+\\dfrac{s}{r} \\right) = \\left( dx+e \\right) \\left( x+f \\right),\n\\quad \\textsf{where} \\quad d=\\dfrac{p}{r} \\textsf{,} \\quad e=\\dfrac{q}{r} \\quad \\textsf{and} \\quad f=\\dfrac{s}{r}.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample 14\n\n\n\nFactorize \\(4x^2+4x-3\\).\nFirst, you need to multiply \\(4\\) and \\(-3\\) together: \\[4 \\cdot (-3) = -12.\\]\nYou need to find the factors of \\(-12\\) that multiply to give \\(-12\\), and add to give \\(4\\).

Remember to use the HCF here so you can factorize fully!\n\\[4x^2+4x-3= 4x^2-2x+6x-3= 2x(2x-1)+3(2x-1).\\] Finally, you can remove the \\((2x+3)\\) common factor, to give the result: \\[2x(2x-1)+3(2x-1)=(2x-1)(2x+3).\\]\nAnd this is your final factorized answer: \\[4x^2+4x-3= 2x(2x-1)+3(2x-1)=(2x-1)(2x+3).\\]"

You decide to stop flipping the coin once you get \\(3\\) ‘heads’; these do not have to be consecutive. Taking ‘heads’ as a success, this can be expressed as \\(X \\sim \\textrm{NB}(3,0.5)\\). It means the probability of success is \\(0.5\\), and you will stop conducting trials after you reach \\(3\\) successes."

Taking ‘heads’ as a success, this can be expressed as \\(X \\sim B(10, 0.5)\\), meaning \\(10\\) trials are conducted, where the probability of success in each trial is \\(0.5\\)."

Taking the buying customers as successes and the total visiting customers as number of trials, there would be 6 successes, allowing you to find the following parameters:\nThen the distribution of the probabilities of a customer purchasing from Cantor’s Confectionery can be expressed as \\(X \\sim \\textrm{Beta}(7,5)\\), meaning the first shape parameter is 7 and the second shape parameter is 5."

It is used to model positive continuous random variables that have skewed distributions.\nNotation: \\(X \\sim \\textrm{Gamma}(\\alpha,\\theta)\\) or \\(X \\sim \\textrm{Gam}(\\alpha,\\theta)\\)\nParameters: Two real numbers \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\theta\\), which are related to the mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\):\nExample: You collect historical data on the time to failure of a machine from Cantor’s Confectionery. The mean is 83 days and the variance is 50.3. You can then use this to estimate the shape and scale parameters of the gamma distribution:\nThe distribution can be expressed as \\(X \\sim \\textrm{Gam}(137,0.61)\\), where the shape parameter is 137 and the scale parameter is 0.61."

It is similar to the geometric distribution, but the exponential distribution uses a continuous waiting time instead of the integer number of trials.\nNotation: \\(X \\sim \\textrm{Exponential}(\\lambda)\\) or \\(X \\sim \\textrm{Exp}(\\lambda)\\)\nParameter: An integer \\(\\lambda\\), representing number of times an event occurs within a specific period of time.\nExample: Customers enter Cantor’s Confectionery at an average rate of 20 people per hour, and the time distance between each visit can be modelled by an exponential distribution. This can be expressed as \\(X \\sim \\textrm{Exp}(20)\\)."

It is commonly used as a reference distribution in hypothesis testing to compare two variances or more than two means, such as Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests.\nNotation: \\(X \\sim F(d_{1},d_{2})\\)\nParameters: Two integers \\(d_1\\) and \\(d_2\\), where - \\(d_{1}\\) degrees of freedom for the random variable \\(X\\sim \\chi^2(d_{1})\\). - \\(d_{2}\\) degrees of freedom for the random variable \\(Y\\sim \\chi^2(d_{2})\\).\nExample: You have three independent groups of data containing Cantor’s Confectionery chocolate bar lengths, and the total sample size is 90. From this, you would like to conduct an ANOVA test investigating if there is a statistically significant difference between the means of each group. You can find the degrees of freedom using the following methods:\nThe \\(F\\) distribution, which will be used as a reference distribution for the ANOVA test, can be expressed as \\(X \\sim F(2,87)\\), meaning the numerator degrees of freedom is \\(2\\) and the denominator degrees of freedom is \\(87\\)."

The use of this distribution is often justified by the Central Limit Theorem: as the sample size increases, the distribution of sample means will resemble a normal distribution more and more closely.\nNotation: \\(X \\sim \\textrm{Normal}(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\) or \\(X \\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\)\nParameters: Two real numbers \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\).\nExample: The lengths of chocolate bars produced by Cantor’s Confectionery follow a normal distribution with a mean of \\(5.6\\) inches and a variance of \\(1.44\\). This can be expressed as \\(X \\sim N(5.6, 1.44)\\), meaning the data is normally distributed, centered at \\(5.6\\) with standard deviation \\(\\sqrt{1.44} = 1.2\\)."

The aim is to produce a clean, accessible, and consistent video that clearly presents worked mathematical examples in the STARMAST visual style. In order to create a video example, you will need to download one of the following notetaking / whiteboard apps onto a tablet. You will require a stylus for handwritten work on the tablet.\n\nWhiteboard by LiveBoard\nNotability by Ginder Labs\nGoodnotes by Goodnotes Limited\n\nOpen a new whiteboard. You will be using the following pen colours: * Black (for the worded part of the example question) * Blue (for any numerical values or equations) * Red (for any comments or warnings)\nSelect your background colour as off-white (#FFFDF5)\nBegin Recording your video. Write the example out clearly and in full. Please remember: You will speed up/ slow down the video in editing, so it is better to make the written work neat than to worry about timings.\nEach finished whiteboard video should:\n\nBe in landscape orientation (16:9).\nHave neutral off-white background (hex #FFFDF5).\nUse handwritten mathematical notation with consistent pen thickness and colour scheme.\nContain no interface buttons, pop-ups, or toolbars visible to the audience.\nInclude only the worked example - no visible face at this stage.\nBe silent at this stage - face and voice recording will be added later in Part C.\nBe exported in high-quality 1080p HD MP4 format.\n\nYou should write the example out clearly and in full. You should write slowly and neatly. The speed of your writing can be adjusted later in editing. Handwriting should be large enough so that it is readable on smaller screens. Leave enough spacing between lines so that notation is not crowded.\n\n\n\nDownload and install the Whiteboard by LiveBoard app. It is available free on the App Store (iPad OS) and Google Play Store. Create your own account. You may be prompted to take out a trial version of the premium version of the app, however this is not necessary.\nCreate a new board by tapping the “+ New Board” button at the bottom right. Choose Landscape orientation.\nSetting the background. This app doesn’t allow custom background colours, so to add in the specific #FFFDF5 background colour, insert this file as an image to your whiteboard and resize it so that it fills the entire canvas area.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Canva and log in using the STARMAST credentials. Find the template ‘Video Thumbnail’ and edit the relevant information for your video.\nSave the Thumbnail.\n\n\n\nTo record yourself talking through the example you will need to download the following: * Teleprompter by Teleprompter App Limited\nOR use Camera on your device.\nEnsure you are in front of a plain, appropriate background.

The sample space contains 5 possible outcomes, and the subset of the sample space that contains values 5 and above is \\(\\{5,6,7,8\\}\\), which contains 4 out of 5 possible outcomes. Therefore, \\(\\mathbb{P}(x\\ge5)=\\frac{4}{5}\\) where \\(x\\) points of damage are dealt to the dragon.\n4.3.

This can be expressed as \\(X \\sim U(1,6)\\). It means \\(1\\) is the minimum value and \\(6\\) is the maximum value, where all discrete values of \\(X\\) for \\(1 \\leq x \\leq 6\\) are equally likely."

(See Guide: Introduction to hypothesis testing for more.) It is a special case of the gamma distribution, as \\(\\chi^2(k)=\\textrm{Gam}(\\frac{k}{2},2)\\).\nNotation: \\(X \\sim \\chi^2(k)\\)\nParameter: The integer \\(k\\) is the number of degrees of freedom in the sample.\nExamples:"

You decide to stop flipping the coin once you get a ‘heads’. Taking ‘heads’ as a success, this can be expressed as \\(X \\sim \\textrm{Geometric}(0.5)\\).

This distribution is used for continuous random variables with heavier tails than the normal distribution, and it is often employed in hypothesis testing where the population standard deviation is unknown. (See Guide: Introduction to hypothesis testing for more.)\nNotation: \\(X \\sim t(\\nu)\\)\nParameter: The integer \\(\\nu\\) representing the degrees of freedom.\nExample: You have a sample of 40 measurements of Cantor’s Confectionery chocolate bar lengths. From this, you would like to conduct a one sample \\(t\\)-test comparing the sample to a hypothesized mean. You find the degrees of freedom:\n\\[\n\\textsf{degrees of freedom = sample size} - 1 = 40 - 1 = 39\n\\]\nThe \\(t\\) distribution, which will be used as a reference distribution for the \\(t\\)-test, can be expressed as \\(X \\sim t(39)\\), meaning the degrees of freedom is 39.

    "text": "i,j,k notation\nIn three-dimensional space, \\(\\mathbf{i}\\), \\(\\mathbf{j}\\), \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) are the vectors with magnitude \\(1\\) pointing in the positive direction along the \\(x\\)-axis, \\(y\\)-axis and \\(z\\)-axis respectively. Any vector in the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system can be generally represented as a sum of scalar multiples of these three vectors \\(\\mathbf{i}\\), \\(\\mathbf{j}\\), \\(\\mathbf{k}\\). Any such combination of vectors is known as a linear combination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: \\(\\mathbf{i},\\mathbf{j},\\mathbf{k}\\) unit vectors along their respective axis.\n\n\n\nFollowing this, any vector \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) can be expressed in the format\n\\[\\mathbf{a}=x\\mathbf{i}+y\\mathbf{j}+z\\mathbf{k}\\]\nwhere \\(x\\) is the coefficient of the vector along the \\(\\mathbf{i}\\)-direction, \\(y\\) is the coefficient along the \\(\\mathbf{j}\\)-direction, and \\(z\\) is the coefficient along the \\(\\mathbf{k}\\)-direction. These coefficients are known as components of the vector: for example, \\(x\\) is the \\(\\mathbf{i}\\)-component of the vector \\(\\mathbf{a}\\).\nHere, a positive \\(x\\) is along the positive \\(x\\)-axis, whereas the vectors towards the negative \\(x\\)-axis would have a negative \\(x\\) value. The same is true for the other two axes as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample 2\n\n\n\nYou are given a vector \\(\\mathbf{a}=2\\mathbf{i}+5\\mathbf{j}+4\\mathbf{k}\\). This means that the vector \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is a free vector moving \\(2\\) units along the positive \\(x\\)-axis, \\(5\\) units along the positive \\(y\\)-axis and \\(4\\) units along the positive \\(z\\)-axis.\nAs \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is a free vector, you can start \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) at any point. Starting the vector \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) at the origin defines the line segment from \\((0,0,0)\\) to \\((2,5,4)\\) in three dimensional space; therefore, \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) is the position vector of the point \\((2,5,4)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample 3\n\n\n\nYou are given a vector \\(\\mathbf{b}=-7\\mathbf{k}+3\\mathbf{i}\\). This means that the vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is a free vector with \\(\\mathbf{i}\\) component \\(3\\), \\(\\mathbf{j}\\) component \\(0\\) and \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) component \\(-7\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample 4\n\n\n\nYou are given the vector \\(\\overrightarrow{AB}\\) where \\(A = (3,4,5)\\) and \\(B = (4,-3,5)\\) are two points in three dimensional space. You can write \\(\\overrightarrow{AB}\\) in \\(\\mathbf{i}\\), \\(\\mathbf{j}\\), \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) notation by considering the distances moved between each of the co-ordinates.\n\nThe \\(x\\)-coordinate of \\(A\\) is \\(3\\) and the \\(x\\)-coordinate of \\(B\\) is \\(4\\). The difference from \\(B\\) to \\(A\\) is \\(4-3 = 1\\), and so the vector has \\(\\mathbf{i}\\) component \\(1\\).\nThe \\(y\\)-coordinate of \\(A\\) is \\(4\\) and the \\(y\\)-coordinate of \\(B\\) is \\(-3\\). The difference from \\(B\\) to \\(A\\) is \\(-3-4 = -7\\), and so the vector has \\(\\mathbf{j}\\) component \\(-7\\).\nThe \\(z\\)-coordinate of \\(A\\) is \\(5\\) and the \\(z\\)-coordinate of \\(B\\) is \\(5\\). The difference from \\(B\\) to \\(A\\) is \\(5-5 = 0\\), and so the vector has \\(\\mathbf{k}\\) component \\(0\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} = 1\\mathbf{i} + (-7)\\mathbf{j} + (0)\\mathbf{k} = \\mathbf{i} - 7\\mathbf{j}\\)."

When the probability is \\(0\\), there is no possibility of the event happening, and when the probability is \\(1\\), the event will definitely happen. Therefore, probability cannot be less than \\(0\\), and it cannot be more than \\(1\\).\nMore formally, if \\(A\\) is an event contained in a sample space \\(S\\), then: \\[0 \\leq \\mathbb{P}(A) \\leq 1.\\]\nThe probabilities of all outcomes in an event always add up to \\(1\\).\nThis can be expressed more formally as: \\[\\sum_{x\\in S}P(x)=1\\]\n\n\n\nFor example, when flipping a coin, the probability of getting heads is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) (a number between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\)), and the probability of getting tails is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). You can add these up together to get: \\[\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}=1\\]\nNotice that, in this case, the probability of ‘heads’ is equal to the probability of ‘tails’ not occurring, and the probability of ‘tails’ is equal to the probability of ‘heads’ not occurring. Therefore, ‘heads’ and ‘tails’ can be called complementary events. You could then, for example, subtract the probability of ‘heads’ from 1 to get the probability of ‘tails’. \\[\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{tails})=1-\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{tails'})=1-\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{heads})=1-\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{2}\\] This is known as the complement rule."

    "text": "Theoretical probability and experimental probability\nThere are two main types of probability: theoretical probability and experimental probability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDefinition of theoretical probability\n\n\n\nTheoretical probability is probability based on what you expect to happen.\n\n\nHere is how you can find theoretical probability:\n\\[\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{event})=\\frac{\\textsf{number of desired outcomes}}{\\textsf{total number of possible outcomes}}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample 4\n\n\n\nRemember from Example 2 that there are six possible outcomes when you roll a standard fair six-sided die; \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\). It’s important to say here that each of the outcomes are equally likely - you have no more probability to roll a six than you do any other number.\nSo, what is the probability of the event where you roll a \\(6\\)? Here, there is one desired outcome - a \\(6\\). The total number of possible outcomes is \\(6\\). Therefore, the probability of rolling a \\(6\\) is: \\[\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{roll a 6}) = \\frac{1}{6}.\\]\nSo, what is the probability of the event where you roll an odd number? Here, there is three desired outcomes - \\(1\\), \\(3\\) and \\(5\\). The total number of possible outcomes is still \\(6\\). Therefore, the probability of rolling an odd number is: \\[\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{roll an odd number}) = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}.\\]\nFinally, what is the probability of not rolling a \\(6\\)? You could work this out using the complement rule. The probability of not rolling a \\(6\\) is the same as \\(1\\) minus the probability of rolling a \\(6\\). Therefore, the probability of not rolling a \\(6\\) is: \\[\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{(roll a 6)}') = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{roll a 6}) = 1- \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{5}{6}.\\] This is the power of the complement rule!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDefinition of experimental probability\n\n\n\nExperimental probability is probability based on what actually happens.\n\n\nHere is how you can find experimental probability:\n\\[\n\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{event})=\\frac{\\textsf{number of times that a desired event occurs}}{\\textsf{total number of trials in an experiment}}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample 5\n\n\n\nSuppose you flip a coin 1000 times. The probability of ‘tails’ may initially be higher or lower than 0.5. However, the more flips you do, the more the probability of ‘tails’ will tend to 0.5. This is an example of the law of large numbers: the more trials you do, the closer your experimental probability will get to the theoretical probability.\nYou can try this for yourself in the following interactive app:\n\n\n#| '!! shinylive warning !!': |\n#|   shinylive does not work in self-contained HTML documents.\n#|   Please set `embed-resources: false` in your metadata.\n#| standalone: true\n#| viewerHeight: 360\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(bslib)\n\n# Hard-coded hex color for the button (blue color requested)\nBUTTON_COLOR &lt;- \"#3F6BB6\"\n\nui &lt;- page_fluid(\n  title = \"Coin Flipper\",\n  \n  card(\n    card_header(\"Coin Flipper\"),\n    card_body(\n      # Use a row layout for landscape orientation\n      layout_columns(\n        col_widths = c(4, 4, 4), # Equal width columns\n        \n        # Left column: Description and stats\n        card(\n          card_body(\n            div(\n              style = \"display: flex;

    "text": "Initial examples\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample 1\n\n\n\nSolve \\(x^{\\frac{1}{2}}=8\\).\nYou can start squaring both sides of the equation to get \\((x^{\\frac{1}{2}})^2 = 8^2\\). Using Law 3, \\((x^{1/2})^2 = x^{2/2} = x\\); so then you get the answer \\(x = 64\\). To check if the answer is correct, you can substitute \\(64\\) back into the equation: \\(64^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt[2]{64}=8\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample 2\n\n\n\nSolve \\(x^{-2}=9\\).\nUsing Law 5, \\(x^{-2} = 9\\) can be re-expressed as \\(\\frac{1}{x^2} = 9\\). Multiplying both sides by \\(x^2\\) gives you \\(1=9x^2\\). Then dividing both sides by \\(9\\) gives you \\(\\frac{1}{9}=x^2\\). Remembering you can have positive and negative roots, you get \\(x= \\frac{1}{3}\\) or \\(x= -\\frac{1}{3}\\) as the two solutions to this equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample 3\n\n\n\nSolve \\(3^{4x}=27^{5-x}\\).\nYou can notice here that the two sides of the equation have different bases; so you need to write these in the same base. As \\(27=3^3\\), the equation can be rewritten as: \\(3^{4x}=(3^3)^{5-x}\\). Then using Law 3, you can write \\(3^{4x}=3^{15-3x}\\). Since the bases of both sides are equal, you can say that \\(4x=15-3x\\). Rearranging gives \\(x= 15/7\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample 4\n\n\n\nSolve \\(x^{\\frac{5}{3}} + 3x^{\\frac{2}{3}} = 10x^{-\\frac{1}{3}}\\).\nIf you look at all of the indices in the question, the denominator is \\(3\\) and that is a hint of what you need to multiply by. Multiply by \\(x^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\) on both sides of the equation; using Law 1, this gives \\[\\begin{align*}\nx^{\\frac{5}{3}}\\cdot x^{\\frac{1}{3}} + 3x^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\cdot x^{\\frac{1}{3}} &= 10x^{-\\frac{1}{3}}\\cdot x^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\\\\nx^{\\frac{6}{3}} + 3x^{\\frac{3}{3}} &= 10x^0\n\\end{align*}\\] Using Law 4, you can further simplify this expression to get \\(x^2 +3x = 10\\), and so \\(x^2+3x-10=0\\). This is a quadratic equation; factorizing this equation gives you \\((x+5)(x-2)=0\\), then you can get \\(x=-5\\) and \\(x=2\\) as the two possible solutions to this equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample 5\n\n\n\nSolve \\(2^{x+1}\\cdot 3^x =72\\).\nHere, you will need to condense the left-hand side into a single base. Using Law 1, you can write that \\[2^{x+1}\\cdot 3^x = 2(2^x\\cdot 3^x) = 72.\\] Next, use Law 7 to combine \\(2^x\\) and \\(3^x\\) into a single base; \\[2(2^x\\cdot 3^x) = 2((2\\cdot 3)^x) = 2\\cdot 6^x = 72.\\] Therefore, \\(6^x = 36\\). Since \\(36 = 6^2\\), it follows that \\(x = 2\\). (Or indeed, you could have taken logarithms of both sides to base \\(6\\).)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample 6\n\n\n\nSolve \\(\\sqrt{(6x)^3}=8\\sqrt{27}\\).\nFirst of all, you can use Law 7 to write \\((6x)^3 = 6^3\\cdot x^3\\). Using Law 10, you can then write the left hand side of this equation as \\[\\sqrt{(6x)^3} = \\sqrt{6^3\\cdot x^3} = \\sqrt{6^3}\\cdot \\sqrt{x^3}\\] You can now work on \\(\\sqrt{6^3}\\); using Law 7 and Law 10, you can write \\[\\sqrt{6^3} = \\sqrt{2^3\\cdot 3^3} = \\sqrt{8}\\cdot \\sqrt{27}.\\] Therefore, the initial equation becomes \\[\\sqrt{(6x)^3} = \\sqrt{8}\\cdot \\sqrt{27}\\cdot\\sqrt{x^3}=8\\sqrt{27}.\\] Dividing both sides by \\(\\sqrt{8}\\) (thereby using Laws 2 and 6) and cancelling the \\(\\sqrt{27}\\) gives \\[\\sqrt{x^3} = \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{8}} = \\frac{8^1}{8^{1/2}} = 8^{1/2} = \\sqrt{8}.\\] Squaring both sides to undo the square root gives \\(x^3 = 8\\), and so \\(x = 2\\)."

    "text": "Examples involving logarithms\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample 7\n\n\n\nSolve \\(e^{3x}=12\\).\nTaking the logarithm of both sides to base \\(e\\) gives you \\(\\log_e(e^{3x})=\\log_e(12)\\). Using the definition of logarithms, you can express the equation as \\(3x = \\ln(12)\\). Rearranging the equation gives you \\(x=\\dfrac{\\ln(12)}{3}\\) and this is your final answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAlthough \\(e\\) here was treated as some constant, it is actually a very important constant called Euler’s number.\nIn addition, there is a special name for \\(\\log_e(x)\\); this is the natural logarithm of \\(x\\), often written \\(\\ln(x)\\).\nTo see more about Euler’s number \\(e\\) and natural logarithms, please read Guide: Logarithms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample 8\n\n\n\nGiven the equation \\(6^x = 3^{x + 1}\\), solve for \\(x\\).\nFirst of all, you can notice that as \\(6\\) is not a power of \\(3\\) (or vice versa) getting these in the same base is difficult. What you can do instead is use the laws of indices to get an expression of the form \\(a^x = b\\) and then take logarithms. Using Law 1, you can write that \\[6^x = 3^x\\cdot 3^1 = 3(3^x)\\] Dividing both sides by \\(3^x\\) and using Law 8 gives \\[\\left(\\frac{6^x}{3^x}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{6}{3}\\right)^x = 3\\] and so you are left with \\(2^x = 3\\). Taking logarithms of both sides to base \\(2\\) gives \\(x = \\log_2(3)\\); and this is your final answer!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample 9\n\n\n\nGiven the equation \\(5^{2x} + 7(5^x) - 30 = 0\\), you are asked to solve for \\(x\\).\nStart by letting \\(y = 5^x\\). Then, you can rewrite the equation given as \\((5^x)^2 + 7(5^x) - 30 = 0\\) using Law 3, which is the same as writing \\[y^2 +7y - 30 = 0.\\]\nRecognizing that this is a quadratic equation (see Guide: Introduction to quadratic equations for more), you can use the quadratic formula or otherwise to show that \\[y = -10 \\quad \\textsf{or} \\quad y = 3.\\]\nAs \\(y = 5^x\\), this means that \\(5^x = -10\\) or \\(5^x = 3\\). By taking the logarithm of both sides to base \\(5\\), you can show that \\[x = \\log_5(-10) \\quad \\textsf{or} \\quad x = \\log_5(3).\\] Remember from above that the logarithm of a negative number is not defined, so \\(x = \\log_5(3)\\) is the only viable solution.\n\n\nThe final example uses many of the laws of indices!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample 10\n\n\n\nSolve \\(3^{3x} = 5^{x-4}\\).\nThis example is similar to Example 8, only with a few extra steps. Once again, as \\(3\\) is not a power of \\(5\\) or vice versa, the strategy is to write the equation in the form \\(a^x = b\\) and then take logarithms of both sides.\nFirst of all, use Law 1 to write \\(5^{x-4} = 5^x\\cdot 5^{-4}\\) and Law 3 to write \\(3^{3x} = (3^3)^x\\). Since \\(3^3 = 27\\), the equation becomes \\[27^x = 5^x\\cdot 5^{-4}\\] Dividing both sides by \\(5^x\\) gives \\[\\frac{27^x}{5^x} = 5^{-4}\\] Using Law 8 and Law 5, you can write \\[\\left(\\frac{27}{5}\\right)^x = \\frac{1}{5^4} = \\frac{1}{625}\\] Taking logarithms to base \\(27/5\\) on both sides gives \\(x = \\log_{27/5}(1/625)\\), which is your final answer."

This may extend to finding the angle between two vectors or testing to see if two vectors are perpendicular or not. The tool you need for these endeavours is the scalar product.\nThe scalar product also known as the dot product (due to the symbol for the operation) or inner product (as one of the many inner products that exist in linear mathematics), essentially measures how much two vectors are pointing in the same direction. This measure can then be used to find the angle between two vectors.\nAs you might imagine, this is an important tool if you are working with vectors in three dimensional space. The scalar product has many applications in geometry, multivariable calculus, physics, and chemistry.\nThis guide will give both the algebraic and geometric definition of the scalar product, explain certain properties of the operation, show you how to find the angle between two vectors using the scalar product, and bring awareness to special cases that arise, such as being able to determine whether or not two vectors are perpendicular.\nAs with all other introductory guides to vectors (including Guide: Introduction to vectors and Guide: Vector addition and scalar multiplication), the vectors in this guide are exclusively three dimensional."

    "text": "The unit circle\nThe unit circle uses this relationship to represent the values of the trigonometric functions. The unit circle is a circle of radius one which is centered on the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system. Because of this, the radius represents the hypotenuse of the right angled triangle. Take \\(\\theta\\) to be the angle as measured anticlockwise from the positive \\(x\\)-axis, and suppose that \\((x,y)\\) is a point on the unit circle.\nIf \\(\\theta\\) is between \\(0\\) and \\(\\pi/2\\), then the triangle created is right angled and the above definition for \\(\\sin\\), \\(\\cos\\), \\(\\tan\\) applies. In this case, \\(\\cos(\\theta)\\) is equal to \\(x\\) and \\(\\sin(\\theta)\\) is equal to \\(y\\).\nHowever, what if \\(\\theta\\) is greater than \\(\\pi/2\\)? Here’s an example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample 2\n\n\n\nSay you want to represent \\(\\sin(\\frac{4\\pi}{3})\\) and \\(\\cos(\\frac{4\\pi}{3})\\) on your unit circle. You would start with an unlabelled unit circle, marking on a line \\(\\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\) radians from the positive \\(x\\)-axis. Now you want to make our triangle. In this case, you can draw a triangle where one side is the negative \\(x\\)-axis. Geometrically you can split the angle into the straight line and the excess which forms our triangle. That means our triangle ‘starts’ \\(\\pi\\) radians away from the \\(x\\)-axis. This means that the angle in our triangle will be \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\) radians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Construction of triangle as in Example 1.\n\n\n\nAs you are using the unit circle, the hypotenuse will be equal to one. Then, you can label the opposite and adjacent sides as shown on the diagram above. As you know that \\(\\sin(\\theta)=\\frac{\\textsf{opposite}}{\\textsf{hypotenuse}}\\) and \\(\\cos(\\theta)=\\frac{\\textsf{adjacent}}{\\textsf{hypotenuse}}\\), you can see that the \\(y\\)-axis will represent \\(\\sin(\\theta)\\) and the \\(x\\)-axis \\(\\cos(\\theta)\\).\nSee Figure 4 for a picture of this angle on the unit circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The unit circle, with a few angles labelled to show the triangles formed; including the angle from Example 1.\n\n\n\n\nSo from Example 1, the value of \\(\\sin(4\\pi/3)\\) and \\(\\cos(4\\pi/3)\\) are the \\(y\\)-axis and the \\(x\\)-axis respectively. Together with the discussion before Example 1, this leads to a new definition of the two trigonometric functions \\(\\sin\\) and \\(\\cos\\):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteDefinition of sin, cos, tan in terms of the unit circle\n\n\n\nLet \\((x,y)\\) be a point on the unit circle centred at the origin \\((0,0)\\). Let \\(\\theta\\) be the angle defined by the positive \\(x\\)-axis and the line segment from centre to the point \\((x,y)\\). Define \\[\\cos(\\theta) = x \\qquad \\sin(\\theta) = y\\] and \\[\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{y}{x} = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\cos(\\theta)}\\]\n\n\nThis definition extends the trigonometric functions to situations outside right-angled triangles; dramatically increasing their usability. The figure below details how the values of \\(\\cos(t), \\sin(t), \\tan(t)\\) change as the angle \\(t\\) changes.\n\n\n\n\n \nIn the unit circle, the angle \\(\\theta\\) ranges from \\(0\\) to \\(2\\pi\\).\nOver this range, the values of the co-ordinates \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) range from positive to negative. Therefore, the three main trigonometric functions \\(\\sin\\), \\(\\cos\\) and \\(\\tan\\) take different signs in different positions.\n\nIf \\(x &gt; 0\\) and \\(y &gt; 0\\) (so \\(0 &lt; \\theta &lt; \\pi/2\\)), then both \\(\\cos(\\theta) &gt; 0\\) and \\(\\sin(\\theta) &gt; 0\\), and therefore \\(\\tan\\theta &gt; 0\\).\nIf \\(x &lt; 0\\) and \\(y &gt; 0\\) (so \\(\\pi/2 &lt; \\theta &lt; \\pi\\)), then \\(\\cos(\\theta) &lt; 0\\) and \\(\\sin(\\theta) &gt; 0\\), and therefore \\(\\tan(\\theta) &lt; 0\\).\nIf \\(x &lt; 0\\) and \\(y &lt; 0\\) (so \\(\\pi &lt; \\theta &lt; 3\\pi/2\\)), then both \\(\\cos(\\theta) &lt; 0\\) and \\(\\sin(\\theta) &lt; 0\\), and therefore \\(\\tan(\\theta) &gt; 0\\).\nIf \\(x &gt; 0\\) and \\(y &lt; 0\\) (so \\(3\\pi/2 &lt; \\theta &lt; 2\\pi\\)), then \\(\\cos(\\theta) &gt; 0\\) and \\(\\sin(\\theta) &lt; 0\\), and therefore \\(\\tan(\\theta) &lt; 0\\).\n\nSee Figure 5 for a picture of this behaviour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: A graphical depiction of signs of trigonometric functions in each quadrant.\n\n\n\nThis analysis has missed out values of the three trigonometric functions on the axes. Here \\(\\theta=0\\) along the positive \\(x\\)-axis, \\(\\theta=\\pi/2\\) along the positive \\(y\\)-axis, \\(\\theta=\\pi\\) along the negative \\(x\\)-axis, and \\(\\theta=3\\pi/2\\) along the negative \\(y\\)-axis.\n\nIf \\(\\theta = 0\\), then \\(x = 1\\) and \\(y = 0\\). Therefore \\(\\cos(0) = 1/1 = 1\\) and \\(\\sin(0) = \\tfrac{0}{1} = 0\\) and so \\(\\tan(0) = \\sin(0)/\\cos(0) = 0/1 = 0\\).\nIf \\(\\theta = \\pi/2\\) (right angle of positive \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes) then \\(x = 0\\) and \\(y = 1\\).

In this case, \\(\\tan(\\pi) = \\sin(\\pi)/\\cos(\\pi) = 0/(-1) = 0\\).\nIf \\(\\theta = 3\\pi/2\\) (right angle of positive \\(x\\) and negative \\(y\\) axes) then \\(x = 0\\) and \\(y = -1\\). Therefore \\(\\cos \\left(3\\pi/2\\right) = 0/1 = 0\\) and \\(\\sin\\left(3\\pi/2\\right) = -1/1 = -1\\). In this case, \\(\\tan(3\\pi/2)\\) is undefined as \\(\\cos (3\\pi/2) = 0\\)."

    "text": "The constant of integration\nYou can ask yourself; is the antiderivative \\(F(x)\\) of a function \\(f(x)\\) unique? The answer here is no, it isn’t. Here’s an example to illustrate this process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample 2\n\n\n\nYou know from Guide: Introduction to differentiation and the derivative that the derivative of \\(f(x) = \\sin(x)\\) is \\(f'(x) = \\cos(x)\\). Because antiderivatives reverse differentiation, it follows that the antiderivative \\(F(x)\\) of \\(\\cos(x)\\) is equal to \\(F(x) = \\sin(x)\\). You can check your answer to see that \\(F'(x) = \\cos(x)\\).\nHowever, \\(F(x) = \\sin(x)\\) is not the only function that differentiates to give \\(\\cos(x)\\). Because the derivative of every constant real number with respect to \\(x\\) is equal to \\(0\\), it follows (for instance) that \\[\\dfrac{\\textrm{d}}{\\textrm{d}x}(\\sin(x) + 19) = \\cos(x) + 0 = \\cos(x).\\] So the antiderivative for \\(\\cos(x)\\) could be equal to \\(\\sin(x) + 19\\) as well. Because the choice of \\(19\\) was random, any real number could take its place, and so \\(\\cos(x)\\) has infinitely many antiderivatives.\nHow can you encapsulate these infinitely in a single answer? The answer is to write \\(F(x) = \\sin(x) + C\\), where the \\(C\\) is any real number. This \\(C\\) is called the constant of integration, and is used to represent the infinitely many possible antiderivatives. Therefore, you can write that \\[\\int\\cos(x) \\,\\textrm{d}x = \\sin(x) + C.\\]\n\n\nLet’s look at this more generally. If \\(F(x)\\) is a function such that \\(F'(x) = f(x)\\), then the indefinite integral (antiderivative) of \\(f(x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is given by \\[\\int f(x) \\,\\textrm{d}x = F(x) + C\\] where \\(C\\), the constant of integration, is any real number.\nIn summary:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen you work out a indefinite integral \\(\\int f(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\), your final answer should be a function plus a constant of integration \\(C\\). This expression represents all the possible antiderivatives of \\(f(x)\\). You should always remember to add a \\(+C\\) at the very end when finding an indefinite integral.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can work out the value of the constant of integration if you have some extra information about \\(x\\) and \\(f(x)\\). This extra information is known as a boundary condition."

    "text": "Phase shift identities\nAs seen in Guide: Trigonometry (degrees), you can use the unit circle to add or subtract an angle to your \\(\\theta\\) and find yourself on another point of the unit circle.\nFor example, suppose that you were to shift the angle by \\(\\pi/2\\) in some direction. Then the distance that was projected on the \\(x\\)-axis is now projected on the \\(y\\)-axis and vice versa. This would lead to a change between \\(\\sin(\\theta)\\) and \\(\\cos(\\theta)\\). These lead to the following properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotePhase shift with \\(\\pi/2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\sin(\\theta\\pm \\pi/2) = \\pm\\cos(\\theta) \\qquad  \\cos(\\theta\\pm\\pi/2) = \\mp\\sin(\\theta)\\] \\[\\sin(\\pi/2-\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta) \\qquad \\cos(\\pi/2-\\theta) = \\sin(\\theta) \\]\n\n\nWhen you move \\(\\pi\\) you get to the opposite side of the unit circle. This would lead to a change of sign as you go on the same distance, on the other side of the axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotePhase shift with \\(\\pi\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\sin(\\theta+\\pi) = \\sin(\\theta-\\pi) = -\\sin(\\theta) \\qquad \\cos(\\theta+\\pi) = \\cos(\\theta-\\pi) = -\\cos(\\theta)\\]\nand so \\[\\tan(\\theta+\\pi) = \\tan(\\theta-\\pi) = \\tan(\\theta)\\]\n\n\nWhen you move \\(2\\pi\\) radians you get back to where you started. Therefore:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotePhase shift with \\(2\\pi\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\[\\sin(\\theta+2\\pi) = \\sin(\\theta) \\qquad \\cos(\\theta+2\\pi) = \\cos(\\theta)\\]\n\n\nFollowing these two results, you can say that \\(\\sin\\) and \\(\\cos\\) are periodic with period \\(2\\pi\\). In fact, for any whole number \\(k\\) (both positive and negative), you can say that\n\\[\\sin(\\theta+2k\\pi) = \\sin(\\theta) \\qquad \\cos(\\theta+2k\\pi) = \\cos(\\theta)\\]\nFor more on this, see guide on [Guide: Multiple revolutions and negative angles]. You can use these equations to work out more trigonometric values:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteExample 5\n\n\n\nUsing the fact that \\(\\cos(\\pi/3) = 1/2\\) and \\(\\sin(\\pi/3) = \\sqrt{3}/2\\), you can work out the values of \\(\\cos(13\\pi/3)\\) and \\(\\sin(-23\\pi/3)\\). Here, you can write \\[\\frac{13\\pi}{3} = \\frac{12\\pi}{3} + \\frac{\\pi}{3} = 4\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\] and so \\[\\cos\\left(\\frac{13\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\cos\\left(4\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}.\\] Similarly \\[-\\frac{23\\pi}{3} = -\\frac{24\\pi}{3} + \\frac{\\pi}{3} = -8\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\] and so \\[\\sin\\left(-\\frac{23\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\sin\\left(-8\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}.\\]"

Work is now being done to replace as many of figures in existing guides as possible.\nHuge thanks to Desmos for providing us with access to their development tools!\n\n\n\nTechnical context\nIn our drive to provide the best, most accessible resources possible, we have been searching for the best way to provide diagrams. At the moment, the diagrams in study guides are static png files produced using TikZ, the inbuilt drawing package in LaTeX. While they look good, they cannot be parsed by screen readers and are liable to scaling issues when moving from computer to phone. Since the inception of the project, STARMAST has looked for better ways to represent mathematical diagrams and boost interactivity of the site.\nInteractive figures powered by Desmos’s development tools solve this issue and then some. We are now able to render complex mathematical ideas in a wholly new and improved way, providing a much wider pedagogical scope than before. In addition to this, these figures come with some accessibility concerns already accounted for – such as being able to display in Braille.\nWork is now being done to replace as many of the old png files in the existing guides as possible, certainly on the website version of the resources. The png files will still need to be maintained in the pdf and docx versions of the resources.\n\n\nVersion history\n\nv1.0 initial version written by tdhc 04/12/24."

At that time, students Krish Chaudhary, Ellie Gurini, and Mark Toner begun a guide on rearranging trigonometric and logarithmic expressions. This guide ballooned in size and was not published as it was too long. Finally, after two years, Tom has adapted the first half of this guide on solving equations involving logarithms and it is now ready for consumption; please see the links below!\n\nGuide: Solving equations involving logarithms\nQuestions: Solving equations involving logarithms\nAnswers: Solving equations involving logarithms\n\nA huge thank you to Krish, Ellie, and Mark for their contributions to these resources, and very sorry that it took so long!\n\n\n\nThe second topic is on the chain rule in multivariate calculus and is written by Donald Campbell, a fourth-year participant in the University of St Andrews VIP project in Semester 2 2024/25 (and a current final-year participant!).

    "text": "A spooky update today from STARMAST HQ! 💫\nLots to say, so let’s get straight into it…\n\n\nAs we move into a place where more and more people are using our resources, the current VIP team have been focusing on making sure the website looks clean and is as accessible as possible. So in anticipation of further content, we have made the following changes:\n\nThe front page and study guide list have been cleaned up with a more accessible contents grid for easier navigation and visibility of resources.\nA new contact page has been written.\nThe background colour is changed to a light blue for ease of reading.\nGoogle Translate widget added to all pages.\nThe full index has been reordered to a more logical list of topics.\n\nPlease let us know any feedback you may have about the new look of the website!\n\n\n\n\n\nSome history of STARMAST here; the project started as a University of St Andrews Summer Teams Enterprise Project in 2023 in order to get the initial guides written and the website off the ground. At that time, students Krish Chaudhary, Ellie Gurini, and Mark Toner begun a guide on rearranging trigonometric and logarithmic expressions. This guide ballooned in size and was not published as it was too long. Finally, after two years, Tom has adapted the first half of this guide on solving equations involving logarithms and it is now ready for consumption; please see the links below!\n\nGuide: Solving equations involving logarithms\nQuestions: Solving equations involving logarithms\nAnswers: Solving equations involving logarithms\n\nA huge thank you to Krish, Ellie, and Mark for their contributions to these resources, and very sorry that it took so long!\n\n\n\nThe second topic is on the chain rule in multivariate calculus and is written by Donald Campbell, a fourth-year participant in the University of St Andrews VIP project in Semester 2 2024/25 (and a current final-year participant!). This guide covers the multivariate chain rule with many many practice questions on the topic.\nThe links to the guide, questions and answers can be found here:\n\nGuide: Multivariate chain rule\nQuestions: Multivariate chain rule\nAnswers: Multivariate chain rule\n\nA big thank you to Donald for writing these guides and resources!\n\n\n\nIn anticipation of her upcoming guide on confidence intervals, Millie Harris (a fourth-year participant in the University of St Andrews VIP project in Semester 1 2025/26) has developed an R Shiny app for working out \\(Z\\)-scores; you can find this at the link below:\n\nCalculator: \\(Z\\)-scores\n\nA big thank you to Millie for writing this!\n\n\n\n\nOur new VIP team (meet them over at our Instagram!) are hard at work on their projects.

The first team of University of St Andrews students have completed their Vertically Integrated Project module working on the site. Here’s a list of materials that they have produced:\n\nOn the website there is a custom CSS style and feedback box, written by Mohit Agarwal.\nLed by Ideja Bajra, STARMAST now has marketing and social media strategies. You can see these in full swing at the STARMAST Instagram account: click here to see the profile.\nPosters explaining the website and what we do, produced by the whole VIP team and presented at the St Andrews VIP conference on November 14 2024. You can find all the materials they produced in the following list:\n\nMain STARMAST poster\nAnnotated website poster\nMarketing strategy poster\nOutreach strategy poster\nPresentation slides at VIP conference\n\n\nAnd, of course, most of the VIP team have been writing guides for the website! Coming soon are guides (and questions and answers) on:\n\nrationalizing the denominator (written by Max Volmar)\nintroduction to simultaneous equations (written by Ollie Brooke)\narithmetic on complex numbers (written by Charlotte McCarthy)\nPMFs and PDFs (probability mass functions and probability density functions, written by Sophie Chowgule)\nHypothesis testing (written by Ellie Trace)\n\nThese guides will be released as soon as they are all ready; stay tuned for more updates.\nFinally, a huge thank you to the entire student team who produced these materials.

    "text": "The aim of this project is to produce accessible online resources for any and all interested students in mathematics and statistics. There are two ways that accessibility can be defined in this context:\n\ntechnical accessibility: ensuring that the way that material is presented is accessible to any user. These include things like ability to screen-read, ability to zoom, correct colour contrasts, etc.\naccessibility of language: ensuring that the material itself is understandable by all who read it. This could include users with specific learning difficulties (such as dyslexia or attention deficit disorder) or low literacy skills, international readers where English is not their first language, or even younger people looking for more mathematical support.\n\nOf these, the fact that you are writing in a language that can output to both HTML and Word documents satisfy the somewhat more stringent technical accessibility requirements (such as screen reading, ability to zoom). In addition, the setup for this project (html settings, a LaTeX document class, docx setup) takes care of some other aesthetic changes such as margins, headings, and line-spacing.\nThe other requirements are up to the writer – you!\nBelow are some guidelines to follow when writing for STARMAST.\n\n\n\nWhen writing for students using these materials, it’s important to know that these students could be coming from any level of mathematical knowledge or any level of literal knowledge. In particular, your reader can have any level of confidence in their ability to do mathematics or statistics.\nThe way that you write can directly affect this confidence. Below are six main principles of writing materials for this project.\n\n\nTraditionally, mathematical writing has used the first-person plural ‘we’, intending to lead the reader on a journey through the material. This is all well and good if you assume that the reader is confident with the work; but what if they are not confident in their ability?\nIf introductory material is written in an exclusive manner, then a student with absolutely no confidence will struggle. Every student needs to feel included and inspired when reading about mathematics or statistics; so write inclusively and in the active voice.\nThe problem is that ‘we’ could be inclusive (including the reader) or exclusive (not including the reader). If this is married to concepts which are quite difficult, it can be quick to feel excluded; not part of the journey. In addition, using ‘we’ can be passive – if you want your reader to do mathematics, saying ‘we see this’ and ‘we deduce that’ may create a false sense of security.\nTherefore, the writing for this project will use the second-person singular ‘you’, with an emphasis on the active voice. Saying ‘you can do this’ rather than ‘we can see that’ helps to instill confidence in the reader, and actually shifts the focus to the reader doing mathematics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour experiences with mathematics are unique, and will not be generally applicable to all students reading your work. If you think that something is ‘easy’ or ‘obvious’, then good for you; but even mentioning this in your writing will crush the confidence of any student reading your work.\nSo nothing is easy. Not even things you learned in high school. Everyone has to start somewhere, and that somewhere might be here. A consequence of this is that nothing should be hard either; present your material objectively.\nBelow is a table of banned adjectives, which does not claim to be complete. You can change most of these into adverbs by adding ‘ly’ to the end; these adverbs are banned too.\n\nA list of banned words.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t use these. Ever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEasy\nObvious\nTrivial\nStraightforward\n\n\nSimple\nEffortless\nPainless\nNot hard\n\n\nFoolproof\nElementary\nBasic\nClear.\n\n\nRun-of-the-mill\nUnchallenging\nNo trouble\nJust\n\n\n\nPlease feel free to let tdhc know if you want to make any addition to the list.\n\n\n\nIf a difficult concept is explained behind jargon or symbols that the student has to look up while trying to understand, then that concept becomes far harder to master. Learning mathematics is hard enough without students trying to translate what is going on.\nHowever, at some point, students will need to be introduced to mathematical terminology. It is a language after all. It is too much to expect to eliminate mathematical or statistical terms entirely, so minimise jargon where you can, and provide references to terms if needed. This includes symbols including the therefore symbol, quantifier symbols, the implied sign, etc; these are often substituted in place for explanation, and learning resources without explanation aren’t good learning resources.\n\n\n\n\nWhich is easier to read or understand: ‘so’, or ‘whenceforth’? How about: ‘deduction’ or ‘working’?\nAgain, there may be significant linguistic barriers to understanding; barriers which should not be in place when trying to learn mathematics. Therefore, keep your writing as simple as possible, and avoiding Latin terms and idioms/proverbs.\nExceptions of course should be made for mathematical terms, which should be clearly defined.\n\n\n\nWhile it may be tempting to relate everything you write to your education (‘saw this in A-level/Higher’, ‘this was in MT2XXX’, ‘this is used in physics’), please avoid this in your general mathematical writing. So avoid context where possible.\nIn general, subject-specific examples are to be avoided. Remember that your reader could be of any background; so including (say) a physics problem may put readers off who have absolutely no knowledge of physics.\nThere are some exceptions; when motivating the subject at hand, you may want to say ‘this is used in X and Y and Z’. This is absolutely fine.\n\n\n\nThe idea of a stage magician conjures up illusory elements; of sleight-of-hand, of work behind the screen, of misdirection and mystery. This is the opposite of our stated mission to make mathematics and statistics accessible for everybody and as inclusive as possible.\nYou may have seen in your education the idea of quick ‘tricks’ to help with mathematics; things like the difference of two squares, or creative addition of 0/multiplication by 1. The trouble is that these steps can be hard to see or justify to a mathematician who is low on confidence.\nTherefore, there’s no such thing as a trick on this website. ‘Technique’ or ‘tool’ are far better words for our purposes. Every time you feel the need to use a ‘trick’ that you learned, consider writing out the working in full."

Since you have no way of cancelling the \\(h\\), you could try and manufacture the definitions of the derivatives of \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\). You have to force the issue slightly by creatively adding \\(0\\); in this case, by adding \\(-f(x)g(x) + f(x)g(x) = 0\\) to the numerator. In addition, you can use properties of limits to get rid of the \\(g(x)g(x+h)\\) in the denominator. Doing these steps and simplifying gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(\\frac{f}{g}\\right)'(x) &= \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(x+h)g(x) - f(x)g(x+h)}{hg(x)g(x+h)}\\\\[0.5em]\n&= \\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(x+h)g(x) - f(x)g(x+h)}{h}\\right)\\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{1}{g(x)g(x+h)}\\right)\\\\[0.5em]\n&= \\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(x+h)g(x) - f(x)g(x) + f(x)g(x) - f(x)g(x+h)}{h}\\right)\\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{1}{g(x)g(x+h)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNow, factorizing this expression, using the properties of limits) and moving \\(g(x)\\) and \\(-f(x)\\) (notice that this needs to be done to ensure the correct definition of the derivative) out of the limits where appropriate gives \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(\\tfrac{f}{g}\\right)'(x) &= \\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\tfrac{f(x+h)g(x) - f(x)g(x) + f(x)g(x) - f(x)g(x+h)}{h}\\right)\\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\tfrac{1}{g(x)g(x+h)}\\right)\\\\[0.5em]\n&= \\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\tfrac{g(x)(f(x+h) - f(x))- f(x)(g(x+h)-g(x))}{h}\\right)\\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\tfrac{1}{g(x)g(x+h)}\\right)\\\\[0.5em]\n&= \\left(\\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\tfrac{g(x)(f(x+h) - f(x))}{h}\\right) + \\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\tfrac{-f(x)(g(x+h) -g(x))}{h}\\right)\\right)\\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\tfrac{1}{g(x)g(x+h)}\\right)\\\\[0.5em]\n&= \\left(g(x)\\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\tfrac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}\\right) - f(x)\\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\tfrac{g(x+h) -g(x)}{h}\\right)\\right)\\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\tfrac{1}{g(x)g(x+h)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Now, as \\(h\\) tends to \\(0\\), it follows that \\(g(x+h)\\) tends to \\(g(x)\\), implying that the final limit tends to \\(1/(g(x))^2\\).

The idea is to take the limit definition of \\((f\\circ g)'(x)\\) and split the limit into the product of the two derivatives \\(f'(g(x))\\) and \\(g'(x)\\). It requires more thought than the proofs of the product and chain rule, primarily due to the reliance on definitions of differentiation and the fact that it isn’t a creative addition of \\(0\\) that splits the derivative, but a creative multiplication by \\(1\\) instead.\n\nAlternative definition of derivative\nProving the chain rule requires the restatement of the limit definition of a derivative at a point \\(a\\). Here are the two definitions side by side.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteLimit definition of the derivative (1)\n\n\n\nThe derivative of \\(f(x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\) at the point \\(a\\) is defined to be \\[f'(a) = \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}.\\]\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteLimit definition of the derivative (2)\n\n\n\nThe derivative of \\(f(x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\) at the point \\(a\\) is defined to be \\[f'(a) = \\lim_{x\\to a}\\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x-a}.\\]\n\n\n(See [Guide: Introduction to differentiability] for more.) To see that these are equal, start with definition (1). Here, \\(h\\) is the variable as the limit depends on \\(h\\). Now, rescale the limit by setting \\(h = x - a\\) (see [Guide: Properties of limits] for more). This gives\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nf'(a) &= \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}\\\\[0.5em]\n&= \\lim_{x-a\\to 0}\\frac{f(a+(x-a)) - f(a)}{x-a}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] As \\(x - a \\to 0\\), it follows that \\(x\\to a\\); in addition, \\(a + (x-a) = x\\). So the limit becomes \\[f'(a) = \\lim_{x-a\\to 0}\\frac{f(a+(x-a)) - f(a)}{x-a} = \\lim_{x\\to a}\\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x-a}\\] so the definitions are the same at a point. Since a function \\(f\\) is differentiable on an interval \\(I\\) of real numbers if and only if \\(f'(a)\\) exists for all \\(a\\) in \\(I\\), it follows that you can use this definition for a differentiable function.\n\n\nIntuition\nThe idea is to start with the second limit definition of the derivative above and put the function \\((f\\circ g)(x) = f(g(x))\\) into the definition to get: \\[(f\\circ g)'(a) = \\lim_{x\\to a}\\frac{f(g(x)) - f(g(a))}{x-a}.\\]\nNow, you would want to generate the derivative of \\(f\\) with respect to \\(g(x)\\) at \\(a\\) and the derivative of \\(g\\) with respect to \\(x\\) at \\(a\\). To do this, you can notice that the \\(x-a\\) is already there for the derivative of \\(g\\). You can multiply top and bottom of the fraction by \\(g(x) - g(a)\\). Since \\(\\frac{(g(x) - g(a))}{(g(x) - g(a))} = 1\\), this does not change the value of the limit. This gives \\[(f\\circ g)'(a) = \\lim_{x\\to a}\\left(\\frac{f(g(x)) - f(g(a))}{x-a}\\cdot \\frac{(g(x) - g(a))}{(g(x) - g(a))}\\right).\\] You can now pull this limit apart to attempt to make the two definitions of \\(f'(g(a))\\) and \\(g'(a)\\). Using the properties of limits to do this gives \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n(f\\circ g)'(a) &= \\lim_{x\\to a}\\left(\\frac{f(g(x)) - f(g(a))}{x-a}\\cdot \\frac{(g(x) - g(a))}{(g(x) - g(a))}\\right)\\\\[0.5em]\n&= \\lim_{x\\to a}\\frac{f(g(x)) - f(g(a))}{g(x)-g(a)}\\cdot \\lim_{x\\to a}\\frac{(g(x) - g(a))}{x-a}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] The second of these terms is \\(g'(a)\\), which is what you want. The first of these terms would be the definition of \\(f'(g(a))\\)… if the limit was \\(g(x)\\to g(a)\\) rather than \\(x\\to a\\). Here is the problem, because you cannot guarantee the behaviour of \\(g(x) - g(a)\\) as \\(x\\) gets closer to \\(a\\); it could be that \\(g(x) - g(a) = 0\\), which is a big problem. In fact, it could be that as \\(x\\) gets closer to \\(a\\), then \\(g(x) - g(a)\\) could be \\(0\\) in infinitely many different places. This needs to be rectified.\n\n\nOvercoming the technicality\nThe idea is to ‘fill in’ the places where \\(g(x) - g(a) = 0\\), by defining the value of the function \\(\\frac{f(g(x)) - f(g(a))}{g(x)-g(a)}\\) at these points. You can define the function \\[\\phi(y) = \\begin{cases} \\dfrac{f(y) - f(g(a))}{y-g(a)} & \\textsf{ if }y\\neq g(a)\\\\[0.5em] f'(g(a)) & \\textsf{ if }y=g(a)\\end{cases}\\] You can notice here that \\(f'(g(a))\\) is already defined as \\(f\\) is a differentiable function, meaning that \\(f'(y)\\) exists for all \\(y\\).\nNow, consider the expression \\[\\phi(g(x))\\cdot \\frac{(g(x) - g(a))}{x-a}.\\] The idea is to prove that \\[\\dfrac{f(g(x)) - f(g(a))}{x-a} = \\phi(g(x))\\cdot \\frac{(g(x) - g(a))}{x-a}\\] for all \\(x\\). This way, you can evaluate the limit of the right hand side instead of the left hand side. However, this does depend on whether or not \\(g(x) = g(a)\\).\n\nIf \\(g(x)\\neq g(a)\\), then \\(g(x) - g(a) \\neq 0\\). You can use the first part of the definition to say that \\[\\phi(g(x))\\cdot \\frac{(g(x) - g(a))}{x-a} = \\dfrac{f(g(x)) - f(g(a))}{g(x)-g(a)}\\cdot \\frac{(g(x) - g(a))}{x-a}\\] Since \\(g(x) - g(a) \\neq 0\\), you can cancel these to get \\[\\phi(g(x))\\cdot \\frac{(g(x) - g(a))}{x-a} = \\dfrac{f(g(x)) - f(g(a))}{x-a}.\\]\nIf \\(g(x) = g(a)\\) then \\(g(x) - g(a) = 0\\) and also \\(f(g(x)) - f(g(a)) = 0\\). This implies that \\[\\phi(g(x))\\cdot \\frac{(g(x) - g(a))}{x-a} = \\phi(g(x))\\cdot 0 = 0.\\]\n\nSo they really are equal. Using this expression, together with the properties of limits gives \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n(f\\circ g)'(a) &= \\left(\\frac{f(g(x)) - f(g(a))}{x-a}\\right)\\\\[0.5em]\n&= \\lim_{x\\to a}\\phi\\left(g(x)\\right)\\cdot \\lim_{x\\to a}\\frac{g(x) - g(a)}{x-a}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] The idea is then to prove that these two limits exist; as then \\((f\\circ g)'(a)\\) would exist. The second of these limits is precisely the definition of \\(g'(a)\\), so let’s focus on the limit of \\(\\phi(g(x))\\) as \\(x\\) tends to \\(a\\). If this function \\(\\phi \\circ g\\) is continuous at \\(a\\) (see [Guide: Introduction to continuity]) then this limit exists and is equal to \\(\\phi(g(a))\\). The function \\(\\phi\\) is defined whenever \\(f\\) is. Since \\(f\\) is differentiable, then it is continuous at every point, including \\(g(a)\\); therefore, \\(\\phi\\) is continuous at \\(g(a)\\). Since \\(g\\) is differentiable at \\(a\\), then \\(g\\) is continuous at \\(a\\). Therefore, by properties of continuous functions (see [Guide: Introduction to continuity]), \\(\\phi\\circ g\\) is continuous at \\(a\\). It follows that \\[\\lim_{x\\to a}\\phi\\left(g(x)\\right) = \\phi(g(a)) = f'(g(a))\\] by definition and so\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n(f\\circ g)'(a) &= \\lim_{x\\to a}\\phi\\left(g(x)\\right)\\cdot \\lim_{x\\to a}\\frac{g(x) - g(a)}{x-a}\\\\[0.5em]\n&= f'(g(a))\\cdot g'(a)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nand this is the chain rule!"

Represent the sample space of this in the form of a list, then calculate the probability that at least 5 points of damage is done to the dragon.\n4.3. You roll a 4-sided die twice to determine your success. If at least one of the rolls results in a 4, you will succeed in committing the action. Represent the sample space of this in the form of a table, then calculate the probability of failing the action.\n4.4. You roll a 9-sided die and a 4-sided die.
