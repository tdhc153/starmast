##Trigonometric equations {-}

The first instance of trigonometric equations you will probably come across will be in the form $cos(x)= a constant$ and you want to find the angle $\theta$. Let's take $cos(x)=0.15$ for an example. This can be done by using your calculator to find $cos^{-1}(0.15)$. These are one step problems, and you will normally have a calculator to solve them. If not, it's likely the angle has a commonly known value, for example $cos(\frac{\pi}{2})=0$. A table of these known values is given in Guide: Trigonometry.

The next set of trigonometric equations you are likely to find are in a similar format. This time, however, instead of just x there would be an equation with x. To solve this. you would solve as the first method, then set that equal to your equation.

## Example 1

Lets say you want to solve $$cos(3x+15)=0.5$$

A good first step is to rename $3x+15$ to $y$. Then, you have a familiar equation $cos(y)=0.5$. You can rearrange this to $cos^{-1}(0.5)=y$, which gives $y=\frac{\pi}{3}$

From there, you can see that $\frac{\pi}{3}=3x+15$ from our definition of y. Please note, I've added in the step of naming y as I find it easier to comprehend, but if you want to use $3x+15$ the whole time, that is also a valid method. 

You can factorise the left hand side to get $\frac{\pi}{3}= 3(x+5)$. Then you can divide both sides of the equation by 3, so that you now have x with no prefix, giving $\frac{\pi}{9}= x+5$. After this, subtract 5 from both sides to isolate x: $\frac{\pi}{9}-5 =x$. In some cases that will be an appropriate answer (for example in maths or this exercise), other times you may want to give a number (like if you are solving a physics problem). In this case $x= -4.65$ to 3 significant figures.

This example has a linear equation inside the trigonometric function, but you would follow the same steps for a quadratic equation in the function. In that case, you would just be solving where your value for y is equal to a quadratic equation, using the methods enclosed in Guide: Quadratic equations.

## Quadratic trigonometric equations {-}

Another type of equation will be a quadratic equation cleverly disguised as a trigonometric equation. This is almost the opposite method from the one just above it. For this, you will want to treat the trigonometric function as the variable and solve the quadratic normally, before using the method above to find the final answer. For example, for $4sin^(2)(x)+6sin(x)+7=0$, you would solve the equation $4y^2+6y+7=0$ and then set $y=sin(x)$ and solve; by this point, y will be a constant. For more information on solving quadratic equations see Guide: Quadratic Equations.

## Trigonometric equations which use identities {-}

The majority of trigonometric equations will make use of trigonometric identities (See the Guide for a list of those). For example, if you see an equation you want to solve which includes a mixture of sin, cos, tan etc, identities should be the first place you look in order to solve it.

##Example 2

Let's start with the equation
$$4cos^2(x)+6sin^2(x)-6=0$$
Initially, you can't solve this equation using the methods described above. This is where trigonometric identities play an important role. This equation can be solved using the fact that $cos^2(x)+sin^2(x)=1$. The way that you know to use this identity is that the equation involves $cos^2(x)$ and $sin^2(x)$.

Firstly, lets rewrite as $4cos^2(x)+4sin^2(x)+2sin^2(x)-6=0$ and from there, $4(cos^2(x)+sin^2(x))+2sin^2(x)-6=0$. Then, use the identity to say that $4(1)+2sin^2(x)-6=0$. You can then move the constants to the left hand side and say that $2sin^2(x)= 2$, or $sin^2(x)=1$. Remember that $sin^2(x)= {sin(x)}^2$ (note that this is NOT the case for $sin^{-1}(x)$, as that is describing the inverse of a function, not raising to the power of -1). Using that, you can rewrite this as $sin(x)=\sqrt{1}=1$. Then, find the inverse sin $sin^{-1}(1)=\frac{\pi}{2}$.

##Example 3

Prove that $4sec^2(x)+3= 4tan^2(x)+7$.

To prove this you use the identity $sec^2(x)=tan^2(x)+1$. You can work from either side, but I find it easier to replace $sec^2(x)$, giivng the equation $4(tan^2(x)+1)+3$ on the left hand side. Now, expanding the brackets should give your final answer.

##Example 4

Trigonometric identities aren't mutually exclusive. For example, we can use that $sec^2(x)=1+tan^2(x)$ to prove that $cos^2(x)+sin^2(x)=1$.

Firstly, rewrite $sec^2(x)$ and $tan^2(x)$ in terms of $cos(x)$ and $sin(x)$. This gives the equation $\frac{1}{cos^2(x)}= 1 + \frac{sin^2(x)}{cos^2(x)}$.

Now, you can rewrite 1 as $\frac{cos^2(x)}{cos^2(x)}$, and get that $\frac{1}{cos^2(x)}=\frac{cos^2(x)+sin^2(x)}{cos^2(x)}$. 

Finally, dividing both sides by cos^2(x) will leave your identity: $1= cos^2(x)+sin^2(x)$

##Logarithmic equations {-}

Here's a quick reminder that you may want to reread the guide on logarithms before starting this section. 

::: {.callout-tip}

Remember that $log_{a}{b}=c$ and $a^c=b$ are interchangeable.

:::

So one type of equation will likely be similar to this: $5^x=25$. If you use the format above, we can label a=5, b=25, and c=x. Then, you would rewrite in the form $log_a{b}=log_5{25}=x$, giving $x=2$.
