This is a dynamic document, and will contain updates once the project gets into full swing and issues/comments are found and added.\ncategories: \n  - Key skills in algebra\nimage: FiguresPNG/introtopartialdifferentiation-image.png\neditor: \n  markdown: \n    wrap: 72\n---\n\n\n\n# Video examples\n\nThis section will explain the style and formatting of how to create\nvideo examples that should accompany examples within each study guide.\nThis will align with content within the STARMAST website. This section\nis split into several parts.\n\n-   Part A will explain how to download, and use, any needed software.\n-   Part B will explain how to create a thumbnail using Canva.\n-   Part C will explain how to record yourself talking through the\n    example.\n-   Part D will explain how to edit the video, using any needed\n    software.\n\n## Part A\n\nThis part explains how to create the written whiteboard/notepad section\nof the video example. The aim is to produce a clean, accessible, and\nconsistent video that clearly presents worked mathematical examples in\nthe STARMAST visual style. In order to create a video example, you will\nneed to download one of the following notetaking / whiteboard apps onto\na tablet. You will require a stylus for handwritten work on the tablet.\n\n-   Whiteboard by LiveBoard\n-   Notability by Ginder Labs\n-   Goodnotes by Goodnotes Limited\n\nOpen a new whiteboard. You will be using the following pen colours: \\*\nBlack (for the worded part of the example question) \\* Blue (for any\nnumerical values or equations) \\* Red (for any comments or warnings)\n\nSelect your background colour as off-white (#FFFDF5)\n\nBegin Recording your video. Write the example out clearly and in full.\nPlease remember: You will speed up/ slow down the video in editing, so it\nis better to make the written work neat than to worry about timings.\n\nEach finished whiteboard video should:\n\n-   Be in landscape orientation (16:9).\n-   Have neutral off-white background (hex #FFFDF5).\n-   Use handwritten mathematical notation with consistent pen thickness\n    and colour scheme.\n-   Contain no interface buttons, pop-ups, or toolbars visible to the\n    audience.\n-   Include only the worked example - no visible face at this stage.\n-   Be silent at this stage - face and voice recording will be added\n    later in Part C.\n-   Be exported in high-quality 1080p HD MP4 format.\n\nYou should write the example out clearly and in full. You should write\nslowly and neatly. The speed of your writing can be adjusted later in\nediting. Handwriting should be large enough so that it is readable on\nsmaller screens. Leave enough spacing between lines so that notation is\nnot crowded.\n\n### Setting up in Whiteboard by LiveBoard\n\n1.  **Download and install** the Whiteboard by LiveBoard app. It is\n    available free on the App Store (iPad OS) and Google Play Store.\n    Create your own account. You may be prompted to take out a trial\n    version of the premium version of the app, however this is not\n    necessary.\n\n2.  **Create a new board** by tapping the \"+ New Board\" button at the\n    bottom right. Choose Landscape orientation.\n\n3.  **Setting the background**. This app doesn't allow custom background\n    colours, so to add in the specific [#FFFDF5 background colour](Figures/fffdf5.png), insert this file as an image to your whiteboard and resize it so that it fills the entire canvas area.\n\n## PART B\n\nOpen Canva and log in using the STARMAST credentials. Find the template\n'Video Thumbnail' and edit the relevant information for your video.\n\nSave the Thumbnail.\n\n## PART C\n\nTo record yourself talking through the example you will need to download\nthe following: \\* Teleprompter by Teleprompter App Limited\n\nOR use Camera on your device.\n\nEnsure you are in front of a plain, appropriate background. Ensure your\nface is visible and your mouth is not covered.\n\nBegin recording and talk through your example in line with the video you\ncreated in Part A.\n\nIf necessary, use 'Voice Memos' to record an audio separately and then\nrecord yourself lipsynching on Camera.\n\nNext week:\n\n-   Write part D for iMovie, Capcut, Shotcut.\n-   In the meantime, we write dropdown sections (not in this qmd\n    document though) about what is different in each of the three\n    different notetaking/whiteboard apps.\n\n## Version history {.unnumbered}\n\nv1.0: initial version created 12/25 by Donald Campbell and Millie Harris\nas part of a University of St Andrews VIP project.\n\n[This work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA\n4.0.](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/?ref=chooser-v1)\n",
