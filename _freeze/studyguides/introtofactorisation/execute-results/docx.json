It involves breaking down expressions into smaller parts called factors, which, when multiplied together, give the original expression. This process is essential for simplifying expressions, solving equations, and gaining a deeper understanding of mathematical structures. Factorization plays a key role in various areas of mathematics and is a valuable tool for tackling problems more efficiently.\ncategories:\n  - Algebra\n  - Solving equations\n  - Key skills\ndraft: true\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Before reading this guide, it is recommended that you read [Guide: Introduction to quadratic equations](introtoquadratics.qmd). Additionally, you may find it useful to read [Guide: Introduction to completing the square](completingthesquare.qmd)*\n\n# What is factorization? {.unnumbered}\n\nFactorization is a process that involves rewriting an expression as a product of expressions. By doing this, you can break down complex algebraic equations into manageable parts, which can then be solved more easily.\n\nAs you have seen in [Guide: Introduction to quadratic equations](introtoquadratics.qmd), quadratic expressions are important in mathematics, and these can be manipulated using factorization to help you solve them. For example, factorizing the expression $x^2 + 5x + 6$ can transform it into $(x+3)(x+2)$, which makes it easier for you to find the values of x that satisfy the equation.\n\nThis guide will introduce you to different methods of factorization, such as identifying common factors, and factorizing quadratics of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$, both where $a=1$, and $a \\neq 1$.\n\n# Introducing key mathematical definitions\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Definition of term\n\nA **term** is a single string of numbers, variables, and/or exponents, and it may also include multiplication or division. Expressions are made up of terms that are added or subtracted.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 1\n\nIn the expression $4x + 7$, both $4x$ and $7$ are terms.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Definition of expression\n\nAn **expression** is a combination of numbers, variables, operations (such as addition or multiplication), and sometimes brackets. An expression represents a value or relationship but does not have an equals sign.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 2\n\n$3x + 5$ is an expression. It contains the number $3$, the variable $x$, and the addition operation.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Definition of factor\n\nA **factor** is a term that divides exactly into another term without leaving a remainder.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 3\n\nThe factors of $6$ are $1, 2, 3$ and $6$. $3$ is a factor of $12$, because $12 \\div 3 = 4$. Similarly, $2x$ is a factor of $6x$, because $6x \\div 2x = 3$.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n\nWhen working with fractions, any non-zero number can be a common factor. For example, $\\frac{1}{2}$ is a factor of $1$ and $2$. However, for simplicity, this guide will focus on whole number factorizations.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Definition of common factor\n\nA **common factor is a number**, variable or expression that divides evenly into each term of an expression.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 4\n\n$$4x \\div 2 = 2x$$ $$6 \\div 2 = 3$$ $2$ is a common factor of $4x$ and $6$, because both $4x$ and $6$ can be divided by $2$.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Definition of highest common factor (HCF)\n\nThe **highest common factor (HCF)** is the largest factor by which two or more terms can be divided without leaving a remainder. It is the greatest number that divides all the given terms evenly and is divisible by all other common factors of the numbers or expressions involved.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 5\nWhat is the HCF of $8$ and $12$?\n\nThe factors of $8$ are $1, 2, 4$ and $8$.\n\nThe factors of $12$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6,$ and $12$.\n\nThey both share the factors $1, 2, and 4,$ so these are all common factors.\n\nThe largest is $4$, so the HCF of $8$ and $12$ is $4$.\n:::\n\n# factorizing single brackets\n\nOne approach to factorizing an expression is by identifying common factors in each term.\n\nFor example, expressions of the form $ax+ab$ can be factorized to become $a(x+b)$ where $a$ is the common factor. To factorize an expression into its simplest form, you must factorize using the HCF.\n\nWhen factorizing, you can take out any common factor shared by the terms in an expression. In real numbers, this means you can take out factors that appear in every term. For example, if an expression contains terms that are all divisible by a common number or variable, you can factor that out to simplify the expression.\n\nThe Steps to factorize an expression fully:\n\n1.  Find a common factor for all the numbers in the expression\n\n2.  Determine the HCF of all the common factors\n\n3.  Write a bracket, with the HCF on the outside, and the remaining terms inside.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nAlways check for the highest common factor before using other factorization methods!\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 6\n\nfactorize $5x+15$.\n\nThe terms are $5x$ and $15$.\n\nThe terms have a common factor of $5$.\n\nfactorizing out the $5$ from both terms gives: $$5x+15=5(x)+5(3)$$There are no other common factors between $x$ and $3$, so $5$ is the HCF. You can then factorize out the HCF, which gives the final form: $$5x+15=5(x+3)$$\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 7\n\nfactorize $6x^2+9x$\n\nThe terms have a common factor of $3$.\n\nfactorizing out the $3$ from both terms gives: $$6x^2+9x=3(2x^2)+3(3x)$$ Now looking at $2x^2$ and $3x$, both terms also contain an $x$, so you can factorize $x$ out as-well to give: $$6x^2+9x=3x(2x)+3x(3)$$\n\nThere are no other common factors between $2x$ and $3$, so the HCF is $3$.\n\nYou can then factorize out the HCF, which gives the final form: $$6x^2+9x=3x(2x+3)$$\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 8\n\nfactorize $x(x-4)+3(2x-8)$\n\nHere, instead of the common factor being a single term, such as $2$ or $x$, the common factor is the bracketed expression $(x-4)$.\n\nfactorizing out $(x-4)$ from both terms gives: $$x(x-4)+3(2x-8)= (x-4)(x)+(3)(2(x-4))$$ $$x(x-4)+3(2x-8)= (x-4)(x)+(6)(x-4)$$ There are no further factors between $x$ and $6$, so $(x-4)$ is the HCF. You can then factorize out the HCF, which gives the final form: $$x(x-4)+3(2x-8)= (x-4)(x+6)$$\n:::\n\n# factorizing double brackets\n\nfactorizing quadratic expressions involves rewriting a quadratic equation (in the form $ax^2+bx+ c$) as a product of two bracketed expressions. This process is essential in algebra and helps simplify expressions, whilst also being able to solve quadratic equations and find their roots.\n\nThere are two main cases when factorizing quadratics that you will learn about:\n\n1.  When $a = 1$\n\n2.  When $a \\neq 1$\n\n## Case 1: $a = 1$\n\nWhen the quadratic expression has the form $x^2+bx+c$, you need to find two numbers that multiply to $c$, and add to $b$. This can be seen as: $$x^2+(d+e)x+de=(x+d)(x+e)$$ However, it is best to see this explained with an example.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 9\n\nfactorize $x^2+7x+10$\n\nYou want to find two numbers that multiply to make $10$ and add to make $7$.\n\nThe positive, whole number, factors of $10$ are $1, 2, 5,$ and $10.$\n\nYou want to look at the factors and see which pairings multiply to make $10$.These are:\n\n$$1\\cdot 10=10$$ $$2 \\cdot 5=10$$\n\nUsing this, you need to select the pairing that adds to make $7$:\n\n$$1+10=11\\neq7 $$\n\nSo, this factor pairing does not have the ability to factorize this quadratic.\n\n$$2+5=7$$\n\nThis is true, so the correct factors are $2$ and $5$. You can now write the factorized form by writing two brackets and putting the variable $x$ at the start of each one:\n\n$$(x  + ?  )(x + ?  )$$\n\nWrite one factor in the first bracket and the other factor in the second bracket, to give:\n\n$$x^2+7x+10=(x+2)(x+5)$$\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nThe order of the factors don't matter, but the signs do! (EXAMPLE)\n:::\n\nNow consider an example with a negative $bx$ term.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nIf the $bx$ term is negative, and the $+c$ is positive, the two factors must both be negative, as two negatives multiplied together creates a positive!\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 10\n\nfactorize $x^2-5x+6$\n\nYou want to find two numbers that multiply to make $6$ and add to make $-5$.\n\nNow, you need to consider all the factors, positive and negative, of $6$.\n\nThe factors of $6$ are $1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, 6,$ and $-6$.\n\nYou want to look at the factors and see which pairings multiply to make $6$ and add to $-5$. These are:\n\n$$-2 \\cdot -3=6$$ $$-2+-3=-5$$\n\nSo, $-2$ and $-3$ are factors of the quadratic.\n\nNow, put them into the brackets like you practised in Example 9: $$x^2-5x+6=(x-2)(x-3)$$\n:::\n\nNow consider an example where the $+c$ term is negative\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nIf the $+c$ term is negative, and the $bx$ term is positive, one factor must be negative, and the other positive, as a positive and a negative multiplied together creates a negative!\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nThe order of the factors don't matter, but the signs do!\n:::\n\nExample 11 is an example of this - if the signs of the factors were swapped, it would result in a different quadratic to the one you have been asked to factorize. \n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 11\n\nfactorize $x^2+x-2$\n\nNow, you need to consider all the factors, positive and negative, of $-2$.\n\nThe factors of $6$ are $1, -1, 2$, and $-2$.\n\nYou want to look at the factors and see which pairings multiply to make $-2$ and add to $1$. These are: $$2 \\cdot -1=-2$$ $$2+-1=1$$So $2$ and $-1$ are factors of the quadratic.\n\nNow, put them into the brackets like you practised in Example 9: $$x^2+x-1=(x+2)(x-1)$$\n:::\n\n## Case 2: $a \\neq 1$\n\nFor quadratic expressions of the form $ax^2+bx+c$ they can be factorized as follows:\n\n$$ax^2+bx+c=(ax+b)(x+c)$$\n\nYou need to multiply $a$ and $b$ together and write out the factor pairs. You must then select the factor pairs that add to $b$, and so you find it more helpful to visualise the quadratic equation in this way: $$dx^2+(e+df)x+ef=(dx+e)(x+f)$$ These are the steps to factorize a quadratic:\n\n1.  Multiply $a$ and $c$ together\n\n2.  Find two numbers that multiply to give $a \\cdot c$, and add to give $b$.\n\n3.  Rewrite the middle term using these two numbers.\n\n4.  factorize by grouping.\n\nThis is best seen with an example.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 12\n\nfactorize $2x^2+5x+3$\n\nYou need to multiply $2$ and $3$ together;\n\n$$2 \\cdot 3=6$$\n\nWrite out the factor pairs of $6$ that add to make $5$:\n\nThe factor pairs of $6$ are $(1,6)$ and $(2,3)$\n\nThe factor pair that multiplies to give $6$ and adds to give $5$ is $(2,3)$.\n\n$$2+3=5$$ $$2\\cdot 3=6$$\n\nNow you can rewrite the original expression, but this time splitting the middle ($bx$) term into the two factors you found earlier.\n\n$$2x^2+5x+3= 2x^2+2x+3x+3$$\n\nIf you look at the expression in two halves, there is a common factor for each half, and you can factorize by grouping:\n\n$$2x^2+5x+3= 2x^2+2x+3x+3= 2x(x+1)+3(x+1)$$ Now, this is similar to the type of factorizing you did in single bracket factorization!\n\nYou can remove the $(x+1)$ common factor, to give the result:\n\n$$2x(x+1)+3(x+1)=(2x+3)(x+1)$$\n\nAnd this gives you your final factorized answer: $$2x^2+5x+3=(2x+3)(x+1)$$\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 13\n\nfactorize $3x^2-2x-5$\n\nYou need to multiply $3$ and $-5$ together: $$3 \\cdot -5=-15$$ Write out the factor pairs of $-15$ that add to make $-2$\n\nThe factor pairs of $-15$ are $(1,-15), (-1,15), (3,-5),$ and $(-3,5)$.\n\nThe factor pair that multiplies to give $-15$ and adds to give $-2$ is $(3,-5)$.\n\n$$3 + -5=-2 $$ $$3 \\cdot -5=-15$$ Now you can rewrite the original expression, but this time splitting the middle ($bx$) term into the two factors you found earlier.\n\n$$3x^2-2x-5= 3x^2+3x-5x-5$$\n\nIf you look at the expression in two halves, there is a common factor for each half, and you can factorize by grouping:\n\n$$3x^2-2x-5= 3x^2+3x-5x-5= 3x(x+1)-5(x+1)$$\n\nNow, this is similar to the type of factorizing you did in single bracket factorization!\n\nYou can remove the $(x+1)$ common factor, to give the result: $$3x(x+1)-5(x+1)=(3x-5)(x+1)$$\n\nAnd this is your final factorized answer:\n\n$$3x^2-2x-5=(3x+5)(x+1)$$\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 14\n\nfactorize $4x^2+4x-3$\n\nYou need to multiply $4$ and $-3$ together, which gives $-12$.\n\nWrite out the number pair that multiplies to make $-12$, and that adds to make $4$:\n\n$$(-2,6)$$\n\nNow you can rewrite the original expression, but this time splitting the middle ($bx$) term into the two factors you found earlier.\n\n$$4x^2+4x-3= 4x^2-2x+6x-3$$\n\nIf you look at the expression in two halves, there is a common factor for each half, and you can factorize by grouping:\n\nNote - Remember to use the HCF!\n\n$$4x^2+4x-3= 4x^2-2x+6x-3= 2x(2x-1)+3(2x-1)$$\n\nNow, this is similar to the type of factorizing you did in single bracket factorization!\n\nYou can remove the $(2x+3)$ common factor, to give the result: $$2x(2x-1)+3(2x-1)=(2x-1)(2x+3)$$\n\nAnd this is your final factorized answer: $$4x^2+4x-3= 2x(2x-1)+3(2x-1)=(2x-1)(2x+3)$$\n:::\n\n# Using factorization to solve quadratic equations\n\nBy factorizing, you can break down a quadratic expression into simplified expressions, making it easier to find values that satisfy the equation.\n\nOnce a quadratic expression is factorized, you can solve it by setting each bracket equal to zero.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 15\n\nRemember from Example 10; $$x^2-5x+6=(x-2)(x-3)$$\n\nSetting this equal to zero;\n\n$$(x-2)(x-3)=0$$\n\nNow, set each individual bracket equal to zero.\n\n$$(x-2)=0$$\n\n$$(x-3)=0$$\n\nNow you can solve each one for $x$: $$x=2$$ $$x=3$$ Once solved, you can see the solutions of $x^2-5x+6$ are $x=2$ and $x=3$.\n:::\n\nUsing tools like Desmos, you can verify your solutions by graphing the quadratic function and identifying the points where it intersects with the x axis.\n\nSeen below is an example....\n\n# Quick check problems\n\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n::: {.webex-check .webex-box}\n\n\nYou are given 4 expressions below.
