They provide a way to calculate probabilities when outcomes depend on multiple possible scenarios or when information is incomplete or indirect. These results are widely used across statistics, particularly in problems involving uncertainty, prediction, and statistical inference. This guide introduces both the law of total probability and Bayes’ theorem, explains how they are derived, and shows how to apply them in practical contexts.\n\n## Law of total probability\n\nIn everyday life, an event can often happen in more ways than one. For example, the chance that a package arrives late might depend on whether it is delivered by courier A or courier B. If each courier is used for a different proportion of deliveries, and each one has a different chance of causing a delay, then the overall chance of delay depends on both which courier is used and how often each one is chosen.\n\nThe **law of total probability** allows you to calculate the total probability of an event by combining its conditional probabilities across several possible scenarios. This approach is especially helpful when outcomes depend on mutually exclusive events (only one possible scenario can occur at a time), each with a known probability.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n### Definition of the law of total probability\n\nSuppose an event $B$ depends on several possible scenarios. These scenarios can be described by events $A_1$, $A_2$, ..., $A_n$, that are:\n\n* **Mutually exclusive**: they cannot occur at the same time, and\n* **Exhaustive**: one of them must always occur.\n\nThen, the **law of total probability** states that the probability of event $B$ is:\n\n$$\nP(B) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(A_i) P(B \\mid A_i)\n$$\nEach term represents the probability of $B$ in one particular scenario.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nThe symbol $\\sum$ is called **sigma notation**. In this case, it is adding the probabilities for each possible scenario where $B$ could happen. For more, see [Guide: Introduction to sigma notation].\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nTo apply the law of total probability:\n\n1. Calculate each scenario’s conditional probability, $P(B \\mid A_i)$.\n2. Multiply these conditional probabilities by their scenario likelihoods, $P(A_i)$.\n3. Add these results to find the total probability of event $B$.\n\nThis accounts for each possible scenario exactly once.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nThe law of total probability comes directly from conditional probability:\n\n$$\nP(B \\mid A_i) = \\frac{P(B \\cap A_i)}{P(A_i)}\n$$\n\nMultiplying by $P(A_i)$ gives the multiplication rule:\n\n$$\nP(B \\cap A_i) = P(B \\mid A_i) P(A_i)\n$$\n\nAs scenarios $A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_n$ are mutually exclusive and exhaustive:\n\n$$\nP(B) = P(B \\cap A_1) + P(B \\cap A_2) + \\dots + P(B \\cap A_n)\n$$\n\nSubstituting the above expressions gives:\n\n$$\nP(B) = P(B \\mid A_1) P(A_1) + P(B \\mid A_2) P(A_2) + \\dots + P(B \\mid A_n) P(A_n)\n$$\n\nWhich results in the law of total probability:\n\n$$\nP(B) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(A_i) P(B \\mid A_i)\n$$\n:::\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 1\n\nAt a hospital:\n\n* $70\\%$ of patients are treated in the general ward,  \n* $30\\%$ of patients are treated in the emergency unit,  \n* The probability a patient in the general ward recovers in $2$ days is $0.8$.\n* The probability a patient in the emergency unit recovers in $2$ days is $0.6$.\n\nWhat is the probability that a randomly selected patient recovers in 2 days?\n\nLet $B$ be the event the patient recovers in $2$ days. Let $A_G$ be the event they are treated in the general ward, and $A_E$ in the emergency unit.\n\nYou know:\n\n* $P(A_G) = 0.7$,  \n* $P(A_E) = 0.3$,  \n* $P(B \\mid A_G) = 0.8$,  \n* $P(B \\mid A_E) = 0.6$.\n\nUsing the law of total probability:\n\n$$\nP(B) = (0.7)(0.8) + (0.3)(0.6) = 0.56 + 0.18 = 0.74\n$$\n\nSo the probability that a patient recovers in $2$ days is $0.74$, or $74\\%$.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 2\n\nAs a student, you can choose to study in three different locations. Most students spend:\n\n* $50\\%$ of the time in the library,  \n* $30\\%$ in a café,  \n* $20\\%$ at home.  \n\nIt is said they concentrate well:\n\n* $90\\%$ of the time in the library,  \n* $60\\%$ of the time in the café,  \n* $40\\%$ of the time at home.\n\nWhat is the probability that the student concentrates well on any given day?\n\nLet $B$ be the event the student concentrates well. Let $A_L$, $A_C$, and $A_H$ be the events that the student studies in the library, café, and home, respectively.\n\nYou know:\n\n- $P(A_L) = 0.5$, $P(B \\mid A_L) = 0.9$  \n- $P(A_C) = 0.3$, $P(B \\mid A_C) = 0.6$  \n- $P(A_H) = 0.2$, $P(B \\mid A_H) = 0.4$\n\nUsing the law of total probability:\n\n$$\nP(B) = (0.5)(0.9) + (0.3)(0.6) + (0.2)(0.4) = 0.45 + 0.18 + 0.08 = 0.71\n$$\n\nSo, the probability that the student concentrates well on any given day is $0.71$, or $71\\%$.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 3\n\nImagine at your school, students receive emails from three types of senders:\n\n* $40\\%$ of the time from teachers,  \n* $35\\%$ from classmates,  \n* $25\\%$ from student societies.  \n\nThe chance of an email containing a typo is:\n\n* $5\\%$ for teacher emails,  \n* $2\\%$ for classmate emails,  \n* $8\\%$ for society emails.\n\nWhat is the probability that a randomly selected email contains a typo?\n\nLet $B$ be the event that the email contains a typo. Let $A_T$, $A_C$, and $A_S$ represent the sender: teacher, classmate, or society.\n\nYou know:\n\n* $P(A_T) = 0.4$, $P(B \\mid A_T) = 0.05$  \n* $P(A_C) = 0.35$, $P(B \\mid A_C) = 0.02$  \n* $P(A_S) = 0.25$, $P(B \\mid A_S) = 0.08$\n\nUsing the law of total probability:\n\n$$\nP(B) = (0.4)(0.05) + (0.35)(0.02) + (0.25)(0.08) = 0.02 + 0.007 + 0.02 = 0.047\n$$\n\nSo, the probability that a school email contains a typo is $0.047$, or $4.7\\%$.\n:::\n\n\n## Bayes' theorem\n\nOften, the probability of one event given another is known, but the reverse is needed. **Bayes' theorem** lets you reverse conditional probabilities, calculating the probability of event $A$ given event $B$, based on the probability of $B$ given $A$. Bayes' Theorem is especially useful for updating predictions as new information becomes available and when it is difficult to calculate probabilities directly.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Definition of Bayes' Theorem\n\nIf $A$ and $B$ are events with $P(B) > 0$, then Bayes' Theorem states:\n\n$$\nP(A \\mid B) = \\dfrac{P(B \\mid A) P(A)}{P(B)}.\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n* $P(A \\mid B)$ is the probability of $A$ given $B$,\n* $P(B \\mid A)$ is the probability of $B$ given $A$,\n* $P(A)$ and $P(B)$ are the individual probabilities of $A$ and $B$, respectively.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nBayes' Theorem is derived directly from the definition of conditional probability. Start with the conditional probabilities of two events $A$ and $B$:\n\n$$\nP(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}, \\quad P(B \\mid A) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(A)}\n$$\n\nRearrange the second equation by multiplying both sides by $P(A)$, giving the multiplication rule:\n\n$$\nP(A \\cap B) = P(B \\mid A) P(A)\n$$\n\nSubstitute this result into the first equation to get:\n\n$$\nP(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(B \\mid A) P(A)}{P(B)}\n$$\nThis gives Bayes’ Theorem, a way to reverse conditional probabilities when direct calculation is difficult.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 4\n\nA school library survey found:\n\n* $15\\%$ of students regularly borrow mystery books.\n* Of students who regularly borrow mystery books, $80\\%$ also borrow science fiction books.\n* In general, $40\\%$ of students regularly borrow science fiction books.\n\nA student is randomly selected and found to regularly borrow science fiction books. What is the probability they also regularly borrow mystery books?\n\nFirst, define the events:\n\n* $M$: A student regularly borrows mystery books.\n* $S$: A student regularly borrows science fiction books.\n\nYou know:\n\n* $P(M) = 0.15$,\n* $P(S) = 0.40$,\n* $P(S \\mid M) = 0.80$.\n\nSo applying Bayes' theorem gives:\n\n$$\nP(M \\mid S) = \\dfrac{P(S \\mid M)P(M)}{P(S)} = \\dfrac{(0.80)(0.15)}{0.40} = 0.30\n$$\n\nSo, given the student borrows science fiction books regularly, there is a $30\\%$ chance they also regularly borrow mystery books.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 5\n\nIn a city, commuters choose transport as follows:\n\n* $60\\%$ travel by bus, and $40\\%$ travel by car.\n* Bus commuters are late $25\\%$ of the time.\n* Car commuters are late $10\\%$ of the time.\n\nYou randomly select a commuter who arrived late today. What's the probability they commute by bus?\n\nFirst, define events:\n\n* $B$: Commuter travels by bus.\n* $C$: Commuter travels by car.\n* $L$: Commuter arrives late.\n\nThen calculate $P(L)$ using the law of total probability:\n\n$$\nP(L) = P(L \\mid B)P(B) + P(L \\mid C)P(C) = (0.25)(0.60) + (0.10)(0.40) = 0.15 + 0.04 = 0.19\n$$\n\nNow applying Bayes' theorem:\n\n$$\nP(B \\mid L) = \\dfrac{P(L \\mid B)P(B)}{P(L)} = \\dfrac{(0.25)(0.60)}{0.19} \\approx 0.7895\n$$\nSo given the commuter arrived late, there's about a $79\\%$ chance they commute by bus.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 6\n\nA factory uses three machines to make its products:\n\n* Machine A produces $50\\%$ of the items and has a $2\\%$ defect rate,  \n* Machine B produces $30\\%$ of the items and has a $5\\%$ defect rate,  \n* Machine C produces $20\\%$ of the items and has a $10\\%$ defect rate.\n\nYou select an item at random and find that it is defective. What is the probability that it was made by Machine C?\n\nLet:\n\n* $A$, $B$, and $C$ be the events that the item came from Machine A, B, or C,  \n* $D$ be the event that the item is defective.\n\nYou know:\n\n* $P(A) = 0.5$, $P(B) = 0.3$, $P(C) = 0.2$,  \n* $P(D \\mid A) = 0.02$, $P(D \\mid B) = 0.05$, $P(D \\mid C) = 0.10$.\n\nFirst, use the law of total probability to find $P(D)$:\n\n$$\nP(D) = (0.02)(0.5) + (0.05)(0.3) + (0.10)(0.2) = 0.01 + 0.015 + 0.02 = 0.045\n$$\n\nNow apply Bayes' theorem to get:\n\n$$\nP(C \\mid D) = \\dfrac{P(D \\mid C)P(C)}{P(D)} = \\dfrac{(0.10)(0.20)}{0.045} \\approx 0.444\n$$\n\nSo, given that the item is defective, there is about a 44% chance it came from Machine C.\n:::\n\n## Quick Check Problems\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n::: {.webex-check .webex-box data-topic=\"TotalProbBayes\"}\n\nIn the following questions, enter your answers as decimal numbers rounded to 2 decimal places.\n\n1.
