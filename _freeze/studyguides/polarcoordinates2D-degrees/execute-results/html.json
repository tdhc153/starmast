They are used as an alternative to Cartesian coordinates and are more suited to characterising some types of curves. Therefore it is important to understand how to convert between Cartesian and polar coordinates, and to sketch curves in polar form.\ncategories:\n  - Algebra\n  - Geometry\n  - Coordinates\nimage: FiguresPNG/completingthesquare-image.png\ndraft: true\n---\n\n\n\n*Before reading this guide, it is recommended that you read [Guide: Introduction to trigonometry](trigonometry-degrees.qmd) and [Guide: Trigonometric identities](trigonometricidentities-degrees.qmd). Optionally, you may also find it useful to read [Guide: Laws of indices](lawsofindices.qmd), [Guide: Introduction to rearranging equations](introtorearrange.qmd), and [Guide: Completing the square](completingthesquare.qmd) for algebraic manipulation.*\n\n**Degrees are used throughout this guide. If you would like to see this guide using radians, please see [Guide: Polar Coordinates 2D (radians)](polarcoordinates2D-radians.qmd).**\n\n# Motivation for using polar coordinates {-}\n\nImagine you are trying to find your friend in a room. One way you can describe where they are is by saying \"walk 5 steps to the right and 12 steps forward.\" This is similar to using Cartesian coordinates. Moving right is the same as moving a length in the $x$ direction, and moving forward is the same as moving a length in the $y$ direction.\n\nAnother way you can describe your friend's location is by pointing at your friend and saying \"walk 13 steps in that direction.\" This is similar to using polar coordinates. You say which way to walk and how far to walk. This is probably a more convenient way of finding your friend and is likely how you would describe their location.\n\nWhen you want to tell someone where a point is on a 2D surface with Cartesian coordinates, you give them two pieces of information: an $x$-coordinate and a $y$-coordinate. With polar coordinates, to tell someone where a point is, you will give them two different pieces of information: a distance and a direction.\n\nPolar coordinates have applications in astronomy, robotics, GPS (global positioning system), and computer graphics.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Definition of a pole\n\nThe distance is measured from a **pole** to the point, where the pole is usually the origin. This is denoted by the letter $r$ and is always positive.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Definition of the initial line\n\nThe direction is measured as the anticlockwise angle from the **initial line**, where the initial line is usually the positive x-axis. This is denoted by the Greek letter phi, **$\\varphi$**. It usually takes a value between $0° \\leq \\varphi < 360°$.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 1\n\n@fig-cartesianagainstpolar shows the same point represented using Cartesian and polar coordinates.\n\n![A point in both Cartesian and polar coordinates](./FiguresPNG/polarcoordinates2D-fig1.png){width=\"100%\" fig-alt=\"A point in both Cartesian and polar coordinates\" #fig-cartesianagainstpolar}\n\n:::\n\n# Converting between Cartesian and polar coordinates\n\nSince both polar and Cartesian coordinates are two ways of describing a point, it is important to know how to convert between them.\n\nSuppose that you have a point with polar coordinates $(r,\\varphi)$.\n\n![A right-angle triangle from a polar coordinate](./FiguresPNG/polarcoordinates2D-fig2.png){width=\"100%\" fig-alt=\"A point in both Cartesian and polar coordinates\" #fig-rightanglepolar}\n\nFrom the figure above, you can see that a right-angled triangle can be formed. The $x$-coordinate is the adjacent side, and the $y$-coordinate is the opposite side. Using trigonometry, it can be seen that:\n\n$$x = r\\cos(\\varphi)$$\nand\n$$y = r\\sin(\\varphi)$$\n\nHere's an example.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 2\n\nConvert the polar coordinates $(4, 60°)$ to Cartesian coordinates.\n\nUsing the formulas above:\n$$x = 4\\cos(60°) = 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 2$$\nand\n$$y = 4\\sin(60°) = 4 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 2\\sqrt{3}$$\nTherefore, the Cartesian coordinates are $(2, 2\\sqrt{3})$.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 3\n\nConvert the polar coordinates $(5, 135°)$ to Cartesian coordinates.\n\nUsing the conversion formulas:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx &= 5\\cos(135°) = 5 \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\\\[1em]\ny &= 5\\sin(135°) = 5 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, the Cartesian coordinates are $\\left(-\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)$.\n\n::: \n\n## Converting from Cartesian to polar coordinates\n\nNow suppose you have Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$ and want to find the polar coordinates $(r, \\varphi)$.\n\nThe distance $r$ from the origin can be found using Pythagoras' theorem:\n$$r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$\n\nThe angle $\\varphi$ can be found using:\n$$\\tan(\\varphi) = \\frac{y}{x}$$\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\nBe careful with the angle! Remember, with polar coordinates the angle is the anticlockwise angle from the positive x-axis. When using $\\tan(\\varphi) = \\frac{y}{x}$, you need to consider which quadrant the point is in. The inverse tangent function, $\\tan^{-1}$, only gives values between $-90°$ and $90°$, so you might need to add or subtract to get the correct angle.\n:::\n\nA good strategy to find $\\varphi$ is:\n\n- Step 1: Calculate $\\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)$\n- Step 2: Check which quadrant the point $(x, y)$ is in through a sketch\n- Step 3: Adjust the angle accordingly. See [Guide: Trigonometry](trigonometry-degrees.qmd) on how to do this\n\n![A graphical depiction of signs of trigonometric functions in each quadrant.](./FiguresPNG/intrototrig-fig5-5.png){width=\"100%\" fig-alt=\"A graphical depiction of signs of trigonometric functions in each quadrant.\" #fig-5}\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 4\n\nConvert the Cartesian coordinates $(3, 3)$ to polar coordinates.\n\nFirst, find $r$:\n$$r = \\sqrt{3^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9 + 9} = \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2}$$\n\nNow find $\\varphi$. Since both coordinates are positive, the point is in Quadrant I.\n$$\\tan(\\varphi) = \\frac{3}{3} = 1$$\n\n$$\\varphi = \\tan^{-1}(1) = 45°$$\n\nTherefore, the polar coordinates are $\\left(3\\sqrt{2}, 45°\\right)$.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 5\n\nConvert the Cartesian coordinates $(-2, 2\\sqrt{3})$ to polar coordinates.\n\nFirst, find $r$:\n$$r = \\sqrt{(-2)^2 + (2\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 12} = \\sqrt{16} = 4$$\n\nNow find $\\varphi$. The point is in Quadrant II (negative x, positive y).\n$$\\tan(\\varphi) = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{-2} = -\\sqrt{3}$$\n\n$$\\tan^{-1}(-\\sqrt{3}) = -60°$$\n\nSince the point is in Quadrant II, you need to add $180°$:\n$$\\varphi = 180° - 60° = 120°$$\n\nTherefore, the polar coordinates are $\\left(4, 120°\\right)$.\n:::\n\n# Converting between Cartesian and polar equations\n\nYou may need to convert entire equations from one coordinate system to another. This is different from converting a single point. Usually we want to write $r$ as a function of $\\varphi$: $r = r(\\varphi)$.\n\nTo do this, you can use the substitutions found through trigonometry as seen below:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx = r\\cos(\\varphi) \\\\[1em]\ny = r\\sin(\\varphi) \\\\[1em]\nr = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\\\[1em]\n\\tan(\\varphi) = \\frac{y}{x}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 6\n\nConsider a circle with radius $3$ and a centre at point $(0, 0)$.\n\nIn Cartesian coordinates, the equation of the circle is $x^2 + y^2 = 9$.\n\nUsing our substitutions:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n(r\\cos(\\varphi))^2 + (r\\sin(\\varphi))^2 = 9 \\\\[1em]\nr^2\\cos^2(\\varphi) + r^2\\sin^2(\\varphi) = 9 \\\\[1em]\nr^2(\\cos^2(\\varphi) + \\sin^2(\\varphi)) = 9 \n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFrom the trigonometric identity:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nr^2(1) = 9 \\\\[1em]\nr^2 = 9 \\\\[1em]\nr = 3\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nSo the polar equation is $r = 3$.\n\n$r$ is interpreted as the distance of a point from the origin. So we can say that the equation $r = 3$ maps to all the points at a distance of 3 units from the origin, creating a circle of radius 3.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 7\nConsider a parabola with equation $y = 2x^2$.\n\nUsing our substitutions:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nr\\sin(\\varphi) = 2(r\\cos(\\varphi))^2 \\\\[1em]\nr\\sin(\\varphi) = 2r^2\\cos^2(\\varphi) \\\\[1em]\n\\sin(\\varphi) = 2r\\cos^2(\\varphi) \\\\[1em]\n\\sin(\\varphi) = 2r \\cdot \\cos(\\varphi) \\cdot \\cos(\\varphi)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nBy dividing both sides by $\\sin(\\varphi)$ and using trigonometric identities:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\sin(\\varphi)}{\\sin(\\varphi)} = \\frac{2r \\cdot \\cos(\\varphi) \\cdot \\cos(\\varphi)}{\\sin(\\varphi)} \\\\[1em]\n1 = 2r \\cdot \\cos(\\varphi) \\cdot \\frac{\\cos(\\varphi)}{\\sin(\\varphi)} \\\\[1em]\n1 = 2r \\cdot \\cos(\\varphi) \\cdot \\cot(\\varphi)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nDividing by $\\cos(\\varphi)\\cot(\\varphi)$ and using more trigonometric identities:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{1}{\\cos(\\varphi)\\cot(\\varphi)} = 2r \\\\[1em]\n\\frac{1}{\\cos(\\varphi)} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\cot(\\varphi)} = 2r \\\\[1em]\n\\sec(\\varphi) \\cdot \\tan(\\varphi) = 2r \\\\[1em]\n\\frac{1}{2}\\sec(\\varphi)\\tan(\\varphi) = r \\\\[1em]\nr = \\frac{1}{2}\\sec(\\varphi)\\tan(\\varphi)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSo the polar equation is $r = \\frac{1}{2}\\sec(\\varphi)\\tan(\\varphi)$.\n\nIn this case, it may be more useful to represent a parabola in Cartesian form rather than polar form. Two trigonometric functions take longer to write than the Cartesian equation for the quadratic!\n:::\n\nNow let us try to convert from a polar equation to a Cartesian equation.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 8\n\nConvert the polar equation $r = 8\\sin(\\varphi)$ to Cartesian form.\n\nNotice that the equation has the $\\sin(\\varphi)$ function. This means that we need to find a way to substitute $\\sin(\\varphi)$ with something in terms of $x$ or $y$.  \n\nBy rearranging the equation $y = r\\sin(\\varphi)$, we get $\\sin(\\varphi) = \\frac{y}{r}$.\n\nUsing our substitutions:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nr = 8 \\cdot \\frac{y}{r} \\\\[1em]\nr^2 = 8y\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow using the substitution $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2})^2 = 8y \\\\[1em]\nx^2 + y^2 = 8y\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis is the Cartesian equation of a circle. By rearranging some more and by completing the square, we can learn more about this curve.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx^2 + y^2 - 8y = 0 \\\\[1em]\nx^2 + (y - 4)^2 - 16 = 0 \\\\[1em]\nx^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 16 \\\\[1em]\nx^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 4^2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nSo the Cartesian equation is $x^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 16$.\n\nThe curve is a circle with centre $(0, 4)$ and radius $4$.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 9\nConvert the polar equation $r^2 = 2 + \\tan^2(\\varphi)$ to Cartesian form.\n\nUsing our substitutions:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n(\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2})^2 = 2 +\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)^2 \\\\[1em]\nx^2 + y^2 = 2 + \\frac{y^2}{x^2}  \\\\[1em]\nx^4 + x^2y^2 = 2x^2 + y^2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSo the Cartesian equation is $x^4 + x^2y^2 = 2x^2 + y^2$.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 10\n\nConvert the polar equation $r = 1 - \\cos(2\\varphi)$ to Cartesian form.\n\nNotice that the equation has the $\\cos(2\\varphi)$ function. The equations that you have been using have the $\\cos(\\varphi)$ and the $\\sin(\\varphi)$ functions. This means that you will need to use a trigonometric identity to turn $\\cos(2\\varphi)$ into functions for which we have expressions.\n\nRemember $\\cos(2\\varphi) \\equiv \\cos^2(\\varphi) - \\sin^2(\\varphi)$.\n\nUsing the identity:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nr = 1 - (\\cos^2(\\varphi) - \\sin^2(\\varphi)) \\\\[1em]\nr = 1 - \\cos^2(\\varphi) + \\sin^2(\\varphi) \\\\[1em]\nr = (1 - \\cos^2(\\varphi)) + \\sin^2(\\varphi) \\\\[1em]\nr = \\sin^2(\\varphi) + \\sin^2(\\varphi) \\\\[1em]\nr = 2\\sin^2(\\varphi)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow, using our substitutions:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nr = 2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{y}{r}\\right)^2 \\\\[1em]\nr = 2 \\cdot \\frac{y^2}{r^2} \\\\[1em]\nr^3 = 2y^2 \\\\[1em]\n(\\sqrt{x^2 +y^2})^3 = 2y^2 \\\\[1em]\n(x^2 + y^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}} = 2y^2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSo the Cartesian equation is $(x^2 + y^2)^{\\frac{3}{2}} = 2y^2$.\n\n:::\n\n# Common polar curves\n\nMany curves look neater when written in polar form than Cartesian form. All Desmos graphs below use $\\theta$ instead of $\\varphi$ as the angle.\n\n## Circles\n\nA circle of radius $a$ centred at the origin has the polar equation $r = a$.
