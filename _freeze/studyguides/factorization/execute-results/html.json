It involves breaking down expressions into smaller parts called factors which, when multiplied together, give the original expression. This process is essential for simplifying expressions, solving equations, and gaining a deeper understanding of mathematical structures. Factorization plays a key role in various areas of mathematics and is a valuable tool for tackling problems more efficiently.\ncategories:\n  - Algebra\n  - Solving equations\n  - Key skills\nimage: FiguresPNG/factorization-image.png\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Before reading this guide, it is recommended that you read [Guide: Introduction to quadratic equations](introtoquadratics.qmd). Additionally, you may find it useful to read [Guide: Completing the square](completingthesquare.qmd) for factorizing with a remainder.*\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<table><tr><td style=\"vertical-align: middle\"><strong>Narration of study guide:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td><audio controls><source src=\"./Narrations/factorization.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio></tr></table>\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n# What is factorization? {.unnumbered}\n\nFactorization is the process of rewriting an expression as a product of other expressions. This transformation helps when working with more complicated expressions. \n\nFactorization is a key concept in mathematics - anywhere where you may be asked to solve equations, chances are that you will need to utilise factorization. As you have seen in [Guide: Introduction to quadratic equations](introtoquadratics.qmd), quadratic expressions are important in mathematics, and these can be manipulated by using factorization to help you solve them. For example, factorizing the expression $x^2 + 5x + 6$ transforms it into $(x+3)(x+2)$, which could help you to find the values of $x$ that satisfy the equation $x^2 + 5x + 6 =0$.\n\nThis guide will introduce you to the key concepts behind factorization. First, you will learn how to identifying common factors and use these to factorizing single expressions. From there, you can use your knowledge to move towards factorizing quadratics of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$; both where $a=1$, and $a \\neq 1$.\n\n# Introducing key concepts\n\nThe first section introduces definitions that you will need throughout this guide. \n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Definition of term\n\nA **term** is a string of numbers, variables, and/or exponents, multiplied or divided together. An **expression** is a combination of terms by the operations of addition and subtraction. An expression represents a value or relationship but does not have an equals sign.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 1\n\n$3x + 5$ is an expression. It contains the number $3$, multiplied by the variable $x$, and the addition operation. The terms are $3x$ and $5$.\n:::\n\nThe introduction of **brackets** turns an expression into a term, as seen in the following example.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 2\n\nTake the expression $t-4$. You can turn this into a term by putting brackets around it to get $(t-4)$. This allows you to multiply or divide everything in the bracket by the same number. For instance, $4(t-4)$ is a term consisting of the multiple of $4$ and $(t-4)$.\n\n:::\n\nNext, you can ask when you can write an expression as a term. This requires the use of **factors**:\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Definition of factor\n\nA **factor** is a term (or expression) that divides exactly into another term (or expression). \n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 3\nWhen working in whole numbers:\n\nThe factors of $6$ are $1, 2, 3$ and $6$. \n\n$3$ is a factor of $12$, because $\\dfrac{12}{3} = 4$. Similarly, $2x$ is a factor of $6x$, because $\\dfrac{6x}{2x} = 3$.\n\nThe term $4$ and expression $t-4$ are both factors of $4(t-4)$.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n\nWhen working with fractions or decimals, any non-zero number can be a common factor. For example, $\\dfrac{1}{2}$ is a factor of $1$ and $2$ - and any other fraction or decimal number!\n\nSo, **this guide will focus on whole number factorizations.**\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Definition of common factor\n\nA **common factor** is a term or expression that divides exactly into each term of an expression.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 4\nWhat is a common factor of $4x$ and $6$?\n\nHere,\n\n$$\\dfrac{4x}{2} = 2x \\quad  \\textsf {and} \\quad \\dfrac{6}{2} = 3.$$\n\n$2$ is a common factor of $4x$ and $6$, because both $4x$ and $6$ can be divided by $2$.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Definition of highest common factor (HCF)\n\nThe **highest common factor (HCF)** is the largest factor by which two or more terms can be divided by, without leaving a remainder. It is the greatest number that divides all the given terms exactly and is divisible by all other common factors of terms involved.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 5\n\nWhat is the HCF of $8$ and $12$?\n\nThe factors of $8$ are $1, 2, 4$ and $8$. The factors of $12$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6$, and $12$.\n\nThey both share the factors $1, 2,$ and $4$; so these are all common factors.\n\nThe largest of these is $4$, so the HCF of $8$ and $12$ is $4$.\n\n:::\n\n# Factorizing single brackets\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Definition of factorization\n\nThe method of rewriting a term or expression as a single product of factors is known as **factorization**. \n\n:::\n\nOne approach to factorizing an expression is by identifying common factors in each term.\n\nFor example, expressions of the form $ax+ab$ can be factorized to become $a(x+b)$ where $a$ is a common factor. To factorize an expression into its **simplest form**, you must factorize using the HCF.\n\nWhen factorizing, you can take out any common factor shared by the terms in an expression. In real numbers, this means you can take out factors that appear in every term. For example, if an expression contains terms that are all divisible by a common number or variable, you can factor that out to simplify the expression.\n\nThe steps to factorize an expression fully:\n\n1.  Find all common factors for all the terms in the expression.\n\n2.  Determine the HCF of all the common factors.\n\n3.  Write a bracket, with the HCF on the outside, and the remaining terms inside.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nAlways check for the highest common factor before using other factorization methods!\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 6\n\nFactorize the expression $5x+15$.\n\nThe terms in this expression are $5x$ and $15$, and they have a common factor of $5$.\n\nFactorizing out the $5$ from both terms gives: $$5x+15=5(x)+5(3).$$ There are no other common factors of $x$ and $3$, so $5$ is the HCF. The final factorized form is: $$5x+15=5(x+3).$$\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 7\n\nFully factorize $6x^2+9x$.\n\nThe terms of this expression are $6x^2$ and $9x$. They have a common factor of $3$. Factorizing out the $3$ from both terms gives: $$6x^2+9x=3(2x^2)+3(3x).$$ \n\nNow looking at $2x^2$ and $3x$, both terms also contain an $x$, so you can factorize $x$ out to give: $$6x^2+9x=3x(2x)+3x(3).$$\n\nThere are no other common factors between $2x$ and $3$, so the HCF of $6x^2$ and $9x$ is $3x$. So, the final, fully factorized form is: $$6x^2+9x=3x(2x+3).$$\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 8\n\nFactorize $x(x-4)+3(2x-8)$.\n\nHere, the common factor of both terms $x(x-4)$ and $3(2x-8)$, the common factor is the bracketed expression $(x-4)$. This is because $(x-4)$ divides $(2x-8)$ exactly.\n\nSo, you can factorize $(x-4)$ from both terms to get: $$x(x-4)+3(2x-8)= (x-4)(x)+(3)(2(x-4)).$$ \nYou can tidy up the second of these terms to get: $$(3)(2(x-4)) = (6)(x-4).$$\nThe expression then becomes: $$x(x-4)+3(2x-8)= (x-4)(x)+(6)(x-4).$$ \n\nThere are no further common factors of $x$ and $6$, so $(x-4)$ is the HCF. So the final factorized form is: $$x(x-4)+3(2x-8)= (x-4)(x+6).$$\n:::\n\n# Factorizing double brackets\n\nFactorizing quadratic expressions involves breaking down quadratic expressions (of the form $ax^2+bx+c$, where $a \\neq 0$) into a product of two brackets, which can make it easier to solve the quadratic expression. This process is essential in algebra, and is used to help simplify expressions, whilst also being able to solve quadratic equations and find their roots. For more information on this, see [Guide: Introduction to quadratic equations](introtoquadratics.qmd).\n\nThere are two main cases when factorizing quadratics that you will learn about. One where $a = 1$, and another where $a \\neq 1$.\n\n## Case 1: $a = 1$\n\nWhen the quadratic expression has the form $x^2+bx+c$, the aim is to find two numbers $d$ and $e$ that multiply to $c$, and add to $b$, such that $de = c$ and $d+e=b$. If you can do this, then you can rewrite the expression as $$x^2 + bx + c = x^2+(d+e)x+de.$$ You can expand the brackets to see that $$x^2+(d+e)x+de = x^2+dx+ex+de.$$ $x$ is a common factor of the first two terms, and $e$ is a common factor of the second two terms, you can factorize using the techniques above to get $$x^2+dx+ex+de = x(x+d) + e(x+d)$$ Since $(x+d)$ is a common factor of both of the terms $x(x+d)$ and $e(x+d)$, you can factorize again to get $$x^2 + bx + c = x(x+d) + e(x+d) = (x+d)(x+e).$$\n\nThis is the desired form of the quadratic expression! It is best to see this process explained with an example.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 9\n\nFactorize $x^2+7x+10$ into a product of two bracketed expressions.\n\nYou want to find two numbers that multiply to make $10$ and add to make $7$.\n\nThe positive factors of $10$ are $1, 2, 5,$ and $10.$\n\nYou want to look at the factors and see which pairings multiply to make $10$. These are:\n\n$$1\\cdot 10=10 \\quad \\textsf{and} \\quad2 \\cdot 5=10.$$\nSince $2+5=7$ and $1+10=11\\neq7$, you pick the correct factors of $10$, which are $2$ and $5$. You can now write the factorized form of your quadratic expression by writing two brackets and putting the variable $x$ at the start of each one:\n\n$$(x  + ?  )(x + ?  )$$\n\nWrite one factor in the first bracket and the other factor in the second bracket, to give the final factorized form:\n\n$$x^2+7x+10=(x+2)(x+5).$$\n:::\n\n\nHere's an example with a negative $bx$ term.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nIf the $bx$ term is negative, and the $+c$ is positive, the two factors must both be negative, as two negatives multiplied together creates a positive.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 10\n\nFactorize $x^2-5x+6$.\n\nYou want to find two numbers that multiply to make $6$ and add to make $-5$.\n\nNow, you need to consider all the factors, positive and negative, of $6$.\n\nThe factors of $6$ are $1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, 6,$ and $-6$.\n\nYou want to look at the factors and see which pairings multiply to make $6$ and add to $-5$. These are:\n\n$$(-2) \\cdot (-3)=6\\quad \\textsf{and} \\quad(-2)+(-3)=-5.$$\n\nSo, $-2$ and $-3$ are the correct factors to use.\n\nNow, put them into the brackets in a similar fashion to Example 9, to give the final factorized form: $$x^2-5x+6=(x-2)(x-3).$$\n:::\n\nFinally, here's an example where the $+c$ term is negative.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nIf the $+c$ term is negative, and the $bx$ term is positive, one factor must be negative, and the other positive, as a positive and a negative multiplied together gives a negative.\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 11\n\nFactorize $x^2+x-2$.\n\nNow, you need to consider all the factors, positive and negative, of $-2$.\n\nThe factors of $-2$ are $1, -1, 2$, and $-2$. You want to look at the factors and see which pairings multiply to make $-2$ and add to $1$. These are: $$2 \\cdot (-1)=-2\\quad \\textsf{and} \\quad 2+(-1)=1.$$\n\nSo $2$ and $-1$ are the correct factors to use.\n\nNow, put them into the brackets in a similar fashion to Example 9, to give the final factorized form: $$x^2+x-1=(x+2)(x-1).$$\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nThe order of the factors don't matter, but the signs do!\n\nExample 11 is an example of this - if the signs of the factors were swapped, it would result in a different quadratic to the one you have been asked to factorize. If you swapped the signs, you would get $(x-2)(x+1)$. When expanded, this gives: $$(x-2)(x+1) = x^2 -2x +x -2$$\n$$ = x^2 -x -2$$\n$$x^2 -x -2 \\neq x^2+x-2.$$\n\n$x^2 -x -2$ is not the original quadratic expression you were asked to factorize, which shows you how if a factor has the incorrect sign, the required quadratic expression will not be factorized correctly.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nIf $c=0$, you can factorize the quadratic expression using the common factor $x$. This is because if $c=0$, then: $$ax^2 +bx +c = ax^2 + bx.$$\nWhich can then be factorized as: $$ax^2 + bx = x(ax + b).$$\nIf $a=1$, this is still true, and is factorized as:\n$$x^2 + bx = x(x + b).$$\n\nExample 7 is an example where $a \\neq 0$ and $c=0$.\n\n:::\n\n## Case 2: $a \\neq 1$\n\nWhen a quadratic expression has the form $ax^2+bx+c$, it can still be factorized, but it requires a different method from the one you used when $a=1$.\n\nThe aim is to find two numbers $d$ and $e$ such that:\n$$d \\cdot e = a \\cdot c \\quad \\textsf{and} \\quad d + e =b.$$\n\nThis works because you can rewrite the middle term ($bx$) as $dx+ex$, which allows you to factorize by grouping. So if you rewrite the expression, it becomes:\n$$ax^2+bx+c= ax^2+dx + ex+c.$$\nYou can now group the expression:\n$$ax^2+dx + ex+c = (ax^2+dx) + (ex+c).$$\nFactorizing each bracket gives:\n$$\\left( ax^2 + dx \\right) + \\left( ex+c \\right) = a x \\left( x+\\dfrac{d}{a} \\right) + e \\left( x+\\dfrac{c}{e} \\right).$$\nSince $d \\cdot e = a \\cdot c$ from the start of your working, dividing both sides by $ae$ gives $\\dfrac{d}{a}=\\dfrac{c}{e}$. You can define this as a value $f$, where $f=\\dfrac{d}{a}=\\dfrac{c}{e}$, and substitute this in to give:\n$$(ax^2+dx) + (ex+c) = ax(x+f) + e(x + f).$$\nThis means that both groups will share the common factor $(x+f)$, and the expression can be factorized further to give:\n$$(ax^2+dx) + (ex+c) = (ax+e)(x+f).$$\nThis is the fully factorized form of the quadratic expression $ax^2+bx+c$ when $a \\neq 1$.\n\n\nThese are the steps to factorize a quadratic of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$:\n\n1.  Multiply $a$ and $c$ together.\n\n2.  Find two numbers that multiply to give $a \\cdot c$, and add to give $b$.\n\n3.  Rewrite the middle term using these two numbers.\n\n4.  Factorize by grouping as above.\n\nYou can see that this method extends Case 1 (where $a = 1$). If $a=1$, then in this case $a\\cdot c = c$ and this method then reduces to the above. Let's see an example\n\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 12\n\nFactorize $2x^2+5x+3$.\n\nYou can follow the steps above.\n\n1. First, you need to multiply $2$ and $3$ together: $2 \\cdot 3=6.$\n\n2. Now you need to consider all the factors of $6$, which are $1,2,3,$ and $6$. You want to look at the factors and see which pairings multiply to make $6$, and add to $5$. These are: $$2+3=5\\quad \\textsf{and} \\quad 2\\cdot 3=6.$$\n\n3. Now you can rewrite the original expression, but this time splitting the middle ($bx$) term into the two factors you found earlier: $$2x^2+5x+3= 2x^2+2x+3x+3.$$\n\n4. If you now look at the expression in two halves, there is a common factor for each half, and you can factorize by grouping:\n\n$$2x^2+5x+3= 2x^2+2x+3x+3= 2x(x+1)+3(x+1).$$ Now, this is similar to the type of factorizing you did in single bracket factorization!\n\nYou can now take out the the $(x+1)$ common factor, to give the result: $$2x(x+1)+3(x+1)=(2x+3)(x+1).$$ And this gives you your final factorized answer: $$2x^2+5x+3=(2x+3)(x+1).$$\n:::\n\nYou don't have to use the steps prescriptively in every example; it was only for instructive purposes.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 13\n\nFactorize $3x^2-2x-5$.\n\nYou need to multiply $3$ and $-5$ together: $$3 \\cdot (-5)=-15.$$ \n\nYou need to find the factors of $-15$ that multiply to give $-15$, and add to give $-2$. These are: $$3 + (-5) =-2\\quad \\textsf{and} \\quad 3 \\cdot (-5)=-15.$$ \n\nNow you can rewrite the original expression, but this time splitting the middle ($bx$) term into the two factors you found earlier: $$3x^2-2x-5= 3x^2+3x-5x-5.$$\n\nIf you look at the expression in two halves, there is a common factor for each half, and you can factorize by grouping: $$3x^2-2x-5= 3x^2+3x-5x-5= 3x(x+1)-5(x+1).$$\n\nYou can now remove the $(x+1)$ common factor, to give the result: $$3x(x+1)-5(x+1)=(3x-5)(x+1).$$\n\nAnd you can write your final factorized answer: $$3x^2-2x-5=(3x+5)(x+1).$$\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nNote that a quadratic $ax^2+bx+c$ can sometimes be factorized in the form: $$(px+q)(rx+s)\\quad \\textsf{where} \\quad p,r \\neq 0.$$\n\nHowever, if you factorize out $r$ from each term you get:\n\n$$\\left( px+q \\right)\\left( rx+s \\right) = \\dfrac{1}{r^2} \\left( \\left( \\dfrac{px}{r} + \\dfrac{q}{r} \\right) \\left( x+\\dfrac{s}{r} \\right) \\right).$$\n\nThis matches the factorized result of $ax^2+bx+c$, so a factorization like $(px+q)(rx+s)$ can be expressed using rational numbers to match any desired form. This can be seen as:\n$$\\left( \\dfrac{px}{r} + \\dfrac{q}{r} \\right) \\left( x+\\dfrac{s}{r} \\right) = \\left( dx+e \\right) \\left( x+f \\right), \n\\quad \\textsf{where} \\quad d=\\dfrac{p}{r} \\textsf{,} \\quad e=\\dfrac{q}{r} \\quad \\textsf{and} \\quad f=\\dfrac{s}{r}.$$\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 14\n\nFactorize $4x^2+4x-3$.\n\nFirst, you need to multiply $4$ and $-3$ together: $$4 \\cdot (-3) = -12.$$\n\nYou need to find the factors of $-12$ that multiply to give $-12$, and add to give $4$. These are:\n\n$$(-2) + 6 =4\\quad \\textsf{and} \\quad(-2) \\cdot 6=-12.$$ \n\nNow you can rewrite the original expression, but this time splitting the middle ($bx$) term into the two factors you found earlier.\n\n$$4x^2+4x-3= 4x^2-2x+6x-3.$$\n\nIf you look at the expression in two halves, there is a common factor for each half, and you can factorize by grouping. Remember to use the HCF here so you can factorize fully!\n\n$$4x^2+4x-3= 4x^2-2x+6x-3= 2x(2x-1)+3(2x-1).$$\nFinally, you can remove the $(2x+3)$ common factor, to give the result: $$2x(2x-1)+3(2x-1)=(2x-1)(2x+3).$$\n\nAnd this is your final factorized answer: $$4x^2+4x-3= 2x(2x-1)+3(2x-1)=(2x-1)(2x+3).$$\n:::\n\n# Using factorization to solve quadratic equations\n\nBy factorizing, you can potentially break down a quadratic expression into simpler expressions. This process makes it easier to understand the structure of the expression and to identify values that satisfy the equation you are solving.\n\nOnce a quadratic expression is factorized, and the equation is set equal to zero, you can find the values of the variable that make each bracket equal to zero.  These values are known as the **roots**, **zeroes**, or **solutions** of the quadratic equation.  This works because $(x+d)(x+e) = 0$ if and only if $(x+d) = 0$ or $(x+e) = 0$. This happens precisely when $x = -d$ or when $x = -e$. \n\nHowever, it's important to remember that this method only works directly when the expression is equal to zero—if it's equal to another number, other steps are needed before factorizing.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 15\n\nSolve $x^2-5x+6=0$.\n\nYou worked out from Example 10 that $$x^2-5x+6=(x-2)(x-3).$$ Setting this equal to zero gives $(x-2)(x-3)=0.$\n\nNow, you can set each individual bracket equal to zero:\n\n$$(x-2)=0\\quad \\textsf{and} \\quad (x-3)=0$$\n\nand you can solve each one for $x$: $$x=2\\quad \\textsf{and} \\quad x=3.$$ \n\nTherefore the solutions of $x^2-5x+6$ are $x=2$ and $x=3$.\n\n:::\n\nUsing tools like Desmos, you can verify your solutions by graphing the quadratic equation and identifying the points where it intersects with the $x$-axis. The roots of the quadratic equations are the points of intersection with the $x$-axis.
