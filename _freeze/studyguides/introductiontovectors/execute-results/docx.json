Vectors are used in various disciplines and have a wide range of real-life applications.\ncategories:\n  - Geometry\n  - Vectors\n  - Linear mathematics\nimage: FiguresPNG/introductiontovectors-image.png\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Introduction {-}\n\nUp until now, the quantities that you have studied in mathematics express ‘how much’ of something exists. For instance, you could have four apples, or be 178cm tall, or have £55 in your bank account. Even negative numbers can be used to represent ‘how much’; if you have -£55 in your bank account, you need to pay in £55 to get to zero again.\n\nHowever, sometimes you need to use something different to express some physical quantities. For instance, suppose you were travelling somewhere to see a friend. It’s not enough to say you are travelling at 30mph — how do you know where you’ll meet? Similarly, saying that you’re going north-west isn’t useful; when will you meet your friend? Sometimes, you need quantities that possess **both** a magnitude (30mph) and a direction (north-west):\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## Definition of a vector\n\nAny physical quantity that has both *magnitude* (size, or length) and *direction* is called a **vector quantity**. \n\n:::\n\n<!-- A **vector** is a quantity that possesses both *magnitude* (size, or length) and *direction*, and so these can be used to model the travel to your friendly gathering above. Quantities that represent magnitude only are called **scalars** -->\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## Definition of a scalar\n\nAny physical quantity that has magnitude only and no direction are called **scalar quantities**. **Scalars** are represented by a single number. They can be positive, negative or zero. \n\n:::\n\n<!-- Examples of scalar quantities in physics include mass, time, distance, volume, temperature, and so on; examples of vector quantities in physics are displacement, velocity, momentum, among others. -->\n\n<!-- ::: callout-tip -->\n\n<!-- ## Magnitude -->\n\n<!-- Size or extent of a physical quantity. **Magnitude** and length can be used inter-changeably when discussing vectors. -->\n\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n\nAs the initial point of study in **linear mathematics**, vectors have various real-life applications across different fields, such as physics and engineering, navigation and GPS, computer graphics and gaming, data analysis and machine learning, cryptography, statistics and much more. In this guide, you will study some of the fundamental concepts about vectors, their algebraic and geometric properties, and an introduction to dealing with magnitude and unit vectors.\n\n<!-- This guide introduces the concept of a vector including what they are in both geometry and algebra and the different ways in which you can write them such as column notation and component. This guide also introduces the magnitude (length) of a vector and the idea of a unit vector.\" -->\n\n<!-- Besides this, a physical quantity, which is a vector, should also follow laws of vector addition. For example, electric current has both magnitude and direction, but it doesn’t follow laws of vector addition (you will see this in the next guide) and hence is not a vector. -->\n\n<!-- ::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"} -->\n\n<!-- ## Example 1 -->\n\n<!-- In classifying $15\\textsf{kg}$, $45\\textsf{m}/\\textsf{s}^2$ and $70\\textsf{W}$ as either a scalar or vector quantity, $15\\textsf{kg}$ and $70\\textsf{W}$ are scalar quantities because mass and power don't have direction, whereas, $45\\textsf{m}/\\textsf{s}^2$ is a vector quantity because accelaration needs direction. -->\n\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n\nTwo vectors are said to be **equal** if they have the same magnitude and the same direction.\n\n:::\n\n# Initial properties of vectors {-}\n\n## Free vectors {-}\n\nA vector can be any directed line in space. Here is a vector $\\mathbf{v}$.\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n![A vector $\\mathbf{v}$](./FiguresPNG/introtovectors-fig0.png){fig-alt=\"A picture of an arrow, with label v in bold.\" #fig-1}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.content-hidden when-format=\"html\"}\n\n![A vector $\\mathbf{v}$](./FiguresPNG/introtovectors-fig0.png){fig-alt=\"A picture of an arrow, with label v in bold.\" #fig-1}\n\n:::\n\nAny vector defined in this way can be denoted by a bold letter $\\mathbf{v}$; or, if you are hand-writing, $\\underline{v}$. These are known as **free vectors**. A free vector $\\mathbf{v}$ can be 'moved' to have any start point in space, as long as the magnitude and the direction are preserved.\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n![Many copies of the vector $\\mathbf{v}$](./FiguresPNG/introtovectors-fig01.png){fig-alt=\"Five copies of the vector $\\mathbf{v}$, each with a label of a bold v.\" #fig-2}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.content-hidden when-format=\"html\"}\n\n![Many copies of the vector $\\mathbf{v}$](./FiguresPNG/introtovectors-fig01.png){fig-alt=\"Five copies of the vector $\\mathbf{v}$, each with a label of a bold v.\" #fig-2}\n\n:::\n\n \n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n\nThe reason that vectors are written in this way is to distinguish them from scalar quantities. You should always remember to **underline** vectors when doing your written work.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"false\"}\n\n## Note\n\nThis study guide will use the bold notation ($\\mathbf{a}$). However, vectors can also be represented by using the arrow notation $\\vec{a}$ or (as previously mentioned) underlining them $\\underline{a}$.\n\n:::\n\n## Localized vectors {-}\n\nAnother way to write a vector is to start and finish at two specified points in space. So consider a line segment $AB$ in space and let a direction be assigned to it. The arrow marked on the line denotes the direction of the vector. The vector from $A$ to $B$ is written as $\\overrightarrow{AB}$. Any vector defined in this way is known as a **localized vector**, as the start point of the vector is a fixed point. \n\nThe direction in which the arrow points towards is called the head of a vector, which makes the other end the tail of the vector. The length of the line indicates the magnitude of the vector and is denoted by $|\\overrightarrow{AB}|$. \n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n![Graphical representation of the vector $\\overrightarrow{AB}$](./FiguresPNG/introtovectors-fig1-1.png){fig-alt=\"Vector $\\overrightarrow{AB}$, with arbitrary length, looks like an arrow pointing from $A$ to $B$, where, $A$ is the tail and $B$ is the head.\" #fig-3}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.content-hidden when-format=\"html\"}\n\n![Graphical representation of the vector $\\overrightarrow{AB}$](./FiguresPNG/introtovectors-fig1-1.png){fig-alt=\"Vector $\\overrightarrow{AB}$, with arbitrary length, looks like an arrow pointing from $A$ to $B$, where, $A$ is the tail and $B$ is the head.\" #fig-3}\n\n:::\n\nHowever, you could also consider the vector from $B$ to $A$, which is written as $\\overrightarrow{BA}$.\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n![Graphical representation of the vector $\\overrightarrow{BA}$](./FiguresPNG/introtovectors-fig2-2.png){fig-alt=\"Vector $\\overrightarrow{BA}$, with arbitrary length, looks like an arrow pointing from $B$ to $A$, where, $B$ is the tail and $A$ is the head.\" #fig-4}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.content-hidden when-format=\"html\"}\n\n![Graphical representation of the vector $\\overrightarrow{BA}$](./FiguresPNG/introtovectors-fig2-2.png){fig-alt=\"Vector $\\overrightarrow{BA}$, with arbitrary length, looks like an arrow pointing from $B$ to $A$, where, $B$ is the tail and $A$ is the head.\" #fig-4}\n\n:::\n\nAny free vector can be turned into a localized vector by specifying a start point. Any localized vector can be turned into a free vector by 'forgetting' the start point. See below for some examples. \n\nAny localized vector that starts at the origin $O = (0,0,0)$ of three dimensional space is known as a **position vector**; as this vector specifies a point in space. Every free vector can be viewed as a position vector.\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n![The position vector for the point $P$ with respect to the origin](./FiguresPNG/introtovectors-fig4-4.png){fig-alt=\"Position Vector $\\overrightarrow{OP}$ with its tail at the origin and head at an arbitrary point $P$.\" #fig-5}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.content-hidden when-format=\"html\"}\n\n![The position vector for the point $P$ with respect to the origin](./FiguresPNG/introtovectors-fig4-4.png){fig-alt=\"Position Vector $\\overrightarrow{OP}$ with its tail at the origin and head at an arbitrary point $P$.\" #fig-5}\n\n:::\n\n## Negative vectors {-}\n\nHere, you can notice that the direction of $\\overrightarrow{BA}$ is exactly opposite to the direction of $\\overrightarrow{BA}$, but with the same magnitude. Therefore, you could write $\\overrightarrow{BA} = -\\overrightarrow{AB}$; in fact, this is the exact definition of the negative of a vector.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## Negative of a vector\n\nLet $\\mathbf{a}$ be a vector. The vector whose magnitude is the same as that of $\\mathbf{a}$ but is in exactly the opposite direction is called the **negative** of $\\mathbf{a}$ and is written $-\\mathbf{a}$.\n\n:::\n\n## Scaling vectors {-}\n\nYou can notice that the negative of a vector $\\mathbf{a}$ is written as $-\\mathbf{a}$, which is the same as $(-1)\\mathbf{a}$. This is a special example of more general behaviour, known as **scalar multiplication of vectors**. \n\nScalar multiplying a vector by a positive scalar changes the magnitude of the vector and preserves the direction, and multiplying a vector by a negative scalar changes the magnitude of the vector and *reverses* the direction.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 1\n\nLet $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ be a vector. Then $2\\overrightarrow{AB}$ is a vector in the same direction as $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ but twice as long, and $-3\\overrightarrow{AB}$ is a vector in the opposite direction as $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ (so the same direction as $\\overrightarrow{BA}$) and three times as long.\n\nSimilarly, $\\frac{1}{2}\\overrightarrow{BA}$ is a vector in the same direction as $\\overrightarrow{BA}$, but half as long. Since the magnitudes of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{BA}$ are the same, it follows that this vector is also half the length of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n\nYou cannot multiply together two vectors, only a vector and a scalar.\n\n:::\n\nFor more on scalar multiplication on vectors, please see [Guide: Vector addition and scalar multiplication](addandsm.qmd). \n\nFinally, there is one special vector that possesses a zero magnitude. \n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## Definition of the zero vector\n\nA vector is said to be the **zero vector** or **null vector** if its magnitude is zero. The zero vector is usually written as $\\mathbf{0}$ (or, if you are handwriting, $\\underline{0}$).\n\nFor any vector $\\mathbf{v}$, it can be shown that $0\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\n:::\n\n<!-- ::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"} -->\n\n<!-- ## Example 2 -->\n\n<!-- When a ball is dropped from a height, gravity acts in the same direction as the motion of the ball, hence, the gravitational force $\\mathbf{a}=10\\textsf{m}/\\textsf{s}^2$.

You will see the standard Cartesian coordinate system in this guide.\n\n## **i,j,k** notation {-}\n\nIn three-dimensional space, $\\mathbf{i}$, $\\mathbf{j}$, $\\mathbf{k}$ are the vectors with magnitude $1$ pointing in the positive direction along the $x$-axis, $y$-axis and $z$-axis respectively. Any vector in the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system can be generally represented as a sum of scalar multiples of these three vectors $\\mathbf{i}$, $\\mathbf{j}$, $\\mathbf{k}$. Any such combination of vectors is known as a **linear combination**.\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n![$\\mathbf{i},\\mathbf{j},\\mathbf{k}$ unit vectors along their respective axis.](./FiguresPNG/introtovectors-fig5-5.png){fig-alt=\"$\\mathbf{i},\\mathbf{j},\\mathbf{k}$ unit vectors along $x,y,z$ axis.\" #fig-6}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.content-hidden when-format=\"html\"}\n\n![$\\mathbf{i},\\mathbf{j},\\mathbf{k}$ unit vectors along their respective axis.](./FiguresPNG/introtovectors-fig5-5.png){fig-alt=\"$\\mathbf{i},\\mathbf{j},\\mathbf{k}$ unit vectors along $x,y,z$ axis. \" #fig-6}\n\n:::\n\nFollowing this, any vector $\\mathbf{a}$ can be expressed in the format\n\n$$\\mathbf{a}=x\\mathbf{i}+y\\mathbf{j}+z\\mathbf{k}$$\n\nwhere $x$ is the coefficient of the vector along the $\\mathbf{i}$-direction, $y$ is the coefficient along the $\\mathbf{j}$-direction, and $z$ is the coefficient along the $\\mathbf{k}$-direction. These coefficients are known as **components** of the vector: for example, $x$ is the $\\mathbf{i}$-component of the vector $\\mathbf{a}$. \n\nHere, a positive $x$ is along the positive $x$-axis, whereas the vectors towards the  negative $x$-axis would have a negative $x$ value. The same is true for the other two axes as well.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 2\n\nYou are given a vector $\\mathbf{a}=2\\mathbf{i}+5\\mathbf{j}+4\\mathbf{k}$. This means that the vector $\\mathbf{a}$ is a free vector moving $2$ units along the positive $x$-axis, $5$ units along the positive $y$-axis and $4$ units along the positive $z$-axis. \n\nAs $\\mathbf{a}$ is a free vector, you can start $\\mathbf{a}$ at any point. Starting the vector $\\mathbf{a}$ at the origin defines the line segment from $(0,0,0)$ to $(2,5,4)$ in three dimensional space; therefore, $\\mathbf{a}$ is the position vector of the point $(2,5,4)$.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 3\n\nYou are given a vector $\\mathbf{b}=-7\\mathbf{k}+3\\mathbf{i}$. This means that the vector $\\mathbf{b}$ is a free vector with $\\mathbf{i}$ component $3$, $\\mathbf{j}$ component $0$ and $\\mathbf{k}$ component $-7$.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 4\n\nYou are given the vector $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ where $A = (3,4,5)$ and $B = (4,-3,5)$ are two points in three dimensional space. You can write $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ in $\\mathbf{i}$, $\\mathbf{j}$, $\\mathbf{k}$ notation by considering the distances moved between each of the co-ordinates.\n\n- The $x$-coordinate of $A$ is $3$ and the $x$-coordinate of $B$ is $4$. The difference from $B$ to $A$ is $4-3 = 1$, and so the vector has $\\mathbf{i}$ component $1$. \n- The $y$-coordinate of $A$ is $4$ and the $y$-coordinate of $B$ is $-3$. The difference from $B$ to $A$ is $-3-4 = -7$, and so the vector has $\\mathbf{j}$ component $-7$. \n- The $z$-coordinate of $A$ is $5$ and the $z$-coordinate of $B$ is $5$. The difference from $B$ to $A$ is $5-5 = 0$, and so the vector has $\\mathbf{k}$ component $0$. \n\nTherefore, $\\overrightarrow{AB} = 1\\mathbf{i} + (-7)\\mathbf{j} + (0)\\mathbf{k} = \\mathbf{i} - 7\\mathbf{j}$.\n\n:::\n\n## Column vector notation {-}\n\nThis is another way of representing vectors. A **column vector** is a vector whose components are listed vertically in a single column, with the $\\mathbf{i}$ component at the top, the $\\mathbf{j}$ component in the middle and the $\\mathbf{k}$ component at the bottom.\n\nSo, a vector $\\mathbf{a}$ can be written as:\n\n$$\\mathbf{a}=x\\mathbf{i}+y\\mathbf{j}+z\\mathbf{k}=\\begin{bmatrix}x\\\\y\\\\z\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\n::: {#example-9-link .callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 5\n\nYou are given the vector $\\mathbf{c}=3\\mathbf{i}-4\\mathbf{j}+5\\mathbf{k}$. To represent this vector in column notation you can write the components of the vector as specified above.

Here, the values of each of the components of the zero vector are $0$, so $$\\mathbf{0} = 0\\mathbf{i} + 0\\mathbf{j} + 0\\mathbf{k} = \\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\0\\\\0\\end{bmatrix}.$$\n\nHow do you express the negative of a vector $\\mathbf{a} = x\\mathbf{i} + y\\mathbf{j} + z\\mathbf{k} = \\begin{bmatrix}x\\\\y\\\\z\\end{bmatrix}$? The negative of a vector is its reverse; so all of the components are multiplied by $-1$. Therefore $$-\\mathbf{a} = (-x)\\mathbf{i} + (-y)\\mathbf{j} + (-z)\\mathbf{k} = \\begin{bmatrix}-x\\\\-y\\\\-z\\end{bmatrix}.$$\n\nFinally, when are two vectors in our notation equal? Let $\\mathbf{a} = a_1 \\mathbf{i} + a_2 \\mathbf{j} + a_3 \\mathbf{k}$ and $\\mathbf{b} = b_1 \\mathbf{i} + b_2 \\mathbf{j} + b_3 \\mathbf{k}$. These two vectors are equal if and only if they have the same direction and the same magnitude; so all the components must match. That is, $$\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{b}\\quad\\textsf{ if and only if }\\quad a_1 = b_1,\\, a_2 = b_2,\\, a_3 = b_3.$$\n\n:::\n\n\n# Magnitudes and unit vectors {-}\n\nSince any free vector $\\mathbf{a}=x\\mathbf{i}+y\\mathbf{j}+z\\mathbf{k}$ can be viewed as a position vector for the point $(x,y,z)$, the magnitude of the vector $\\mathbf{a}$ is the same as the distance from the origin $(0,0,0)$ to the point $(x,y,z)$. This gives: \n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## Magnitude of a vector\n\nLet $\\displaystyle\\mathbf{a} = x\\mathbf{i}+y\\mathbf{j}+z\\mathbf{k} = \\begin{bmatrix}x\\\\y\\\\z\\end{bmatrix}$ be a vector.

What are their magnitudes?\n\nYou can use the formula for the magnitude of a vector as given above. For the vector $\\mathbf{p}$, this is where the $\\mathbf{i}$ component is $1$, the $\\mathbf{j}$ component is $4$, and the $\\mathbf{k}$ component is $-8$. So $$|\\mathbf{p}|= \\sqrt{(1)^2 + (4)^2 + (-8)^2} = \\sqrt{1+16+64} = \\sqrt{81} = 9$$\n\nSimilarly, the magnitude for $\\mathbf{q} = =-4\\mathbf{i}+2\\mathbf{j}+11\\mathbf{k}$ is $$|\\mathbf{q}| = \\sqrt{(-4)^2 + (2)^2 + (11)^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 4 + 121} = \\sqrt{141}$$\n\n:::\n\nSince the magnitude of a vector $\\mathbf{a}$ is a scalar, you can scalar multiply by $1/|\\mathbf{a}|$, which is the same as dividing the vector $\\mathbf{a}$ by $|\\mathbf{a}|$. As scalar multiplication does not change the direction of a vector, the vector $\\mathbf{a}/|\\mathbf{a}|$ has the same direction as $\\mathbf{a}$ and magnitude $|\\mathbf{a}|/|\\mathbf{a}| = 1$. This has a special name:\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## Unit vector\n\nAny vector with a magnitude equal to $1$ is called a **unit vector**. \n\nUnit vectors can be constructed in any direction.

What are the unit vectors in the directions of $\\mathbf{p}$ and $\\mathbf{q}$?\n\nYou worked out in Example 7 that the magnitude of $\\mathbf{p}$ is $|\\mathbf{p}| = 9$. Therefore, the unit vector in the direction of $\\mathbf{p}$ is $$\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} = \\frac{\\mathbf{p}}{|\\mathbf{p}|} = \\frac{\\mathbf{i}+4\\mathbf{j}-8\\mathbf{k}}{9} = \\frac{1}{9}\\left(\\mathbf{i}+4\\mathbf{j}-8\\mathbf{k}\\right)$$\n\nSimilarly, you worked out in Example 7 that the magnitude of $\\mathbf{q}$ is $|\\mathbf{q}| = \\sqrt{141}$.
