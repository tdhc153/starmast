It allows you to examine how changes in one variable affect others without explicitly solving for the other variables.\ncategories:\n  - Calculus\nimage: FiguresPNG/introtodifferentiation-image.png\ndraft: true\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Before reading this guide, it is recommended that you read [Guide: Multivariate chain rule](multivariatechainrule.qmd) and [Guide: Implicit differentiation](implicitdifferentiation.qmd).*\n\n# What is multivariate implicit differentiation?\n\nIn [Guide: Multivariate chain rule](multivariatechainrule.qmd), you learned how to apply the multivariate chain rule to many different functions, however there are some cases where this rule is impossible to apply. **Implicit differentiation** is a technique used in calculus for when you have a relationship between two variables $x$ and $y$ that would make it difficult to solve for one in terms of the other. Instead of isolating $y$ explicitly (writing the equation as $y = \\textsf{terms in }x$), you differentiate the entire expression using the **chain rule** and **partial derivatives**.\n\nFor example, consider the surface of a sphere defined by $x^2+y^2+z^2=r^2$. This equation implicitly relates $x$, $y$ and $z$. If you want to know how the height $z$ changes as you move along the $x$-direction, you can use multivariate implicit differentiation without having to even solve for $z$.\n\nThe fuel efficiency of a car depends on speed, tyre pressures, and engine temperature. These variables are all related, but there is no specific formula that tells you how one affects another directly. To find how one variable changes with respect to another, you need to use multivariate implicit differentiation.\n\nTo understand the idea of multivariate implicit differentiation, it is important to define what the differences are between explicit and implicit functions first.\n\n# Explicit and implicit functions\n\nAn **explicit function** expresses one variable directly in terms of the other variables. The method to compute the dependent variable from the independent variables is consistent and often requires rearranging the equation for the dependent variable of interest.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Explicit function\n\nAn explicit function takes the form $y=f(x)$.\n\nIt is a function that can be rearranged into a form where $y$ is distinctly written as a function of only $x$.\n:::\n\n::: callout-tip\nA handy way to think of this functional form is as $y = \\textsf{terms involving only } x$.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 1\n\nAn example of an explicit function is the function $y = 2x+3$. The function has been written in the form $y=f(x)$ and you can directly compute $y$ for any value of $x$.\n\nAnother example of an explicit function is the function $x^2 = \\dfrac{3y+2}{y-1}$ which can be rearranged into its explicit form $y = \\dfrac{x^2+2}{x^2-3}$.\n:::\n\nAn **implicit function** defines a relationship between variables without necessarily expressing one variable directly in terms of the others. For example, unlike explicit functions where you can write $y$ as a function of $x$, implicit functions may not allow you to isolate $y$. In some cases, isolating $y$ algebraically might be very difficult or impossible, or doing so may give multiple values of $y$ for a single $x$ meaning the result is not a function.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Implicit function\n\nAn implicit function takes the form $f(x,y) = 0$.\n\nIt is a function where the variables are so entangled that either you cannot rearrange the equation to write $y$ distinctly as a function of $x$, or the rearranged form would violate the definition of a function (for example, by producing multiple $y$ values for a single $x$). In such cases, you need to treat the relationship implicitly.\n:::\n\n::: callout-tip\nA handy way to think of this functional form is as $\\textsf{terms involving both } x \\textsf{ and } y = 0$, where solving explicitly for $y$ either leads to multiple values or requires techniques (like implicit differentiation) that do not involve isolating $y$ algebraically.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 2\n\nAn example of an implicit function is the equation $x^3 + y^3 - 3xy - 7 = 0$. The equation has been written in the functional form $f(x,y) = 0$. Rearranging it explicitly for $y$ is not straightforward, and in some cases may not even be possible using standard algebraic techniques.\n\nAnother example of an implicit function is $x^2 + y^2 - 25 = 0$ which is the equation of a circle of radius $5$. This has a solution $y = \\pm \\sqrt{25 - x^2}$, which is not a function, as a function cannot take on two values of $y$ for the same value of $x$. So, even though you can rearrange the equation, the result is not an explicit function. Therefore, when written in the form $x^2 + y^2 - 25 = 0$, it has been written implicitly.\n:::\n\n# Paths and contours in the $(x,y)$-plane\n\nImagine you are walking on a surface defined by a function $z=g(x,y)$ that specifies the $z$-coordinate height above or below the $(x,y)$-plane. The horizontal coordinates are $x$ and $y$, and the height at each point is $z$.\n\nA **path** is a curve you take as you move over the surface. As you move along a path, the $z$-coordinate height changes. The total rate of change of the height as you move is given by $$\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}z}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\dfrac{\\partial{z}}{\\partial{x}}\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\dfrac{\\partial{z}}{\\partial{y}}\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\n\nAs seen in [Guide: Multivariate chain rule](multivariatechainrule.qmd), this is the **multivariate chain rule** for two dependent variables $x$ and $y$ with one independent variable $t$.\n\nA **contour** is a path where the height (or **function value**) $z$ on this surface you are walking along stays the same. On a map, contour lines show regions of constant elevation. Walking along a contour line means you remain at the same height, whereas walking across contour lines means you are either going up or going down.\n\nThis means that a contour of a surface defined by $z=g(x,y)$ is the set of all points for which the function value $z$ is constant. This is often written as $g(x,y) = \\textsf{constant}$.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 3\n\nConsider the function $z = g(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - 25$. This function represents all the points $(x,y)$ on a paraboloid (a three-dimensional shape which is shown below).\n\nIf you specify $z = g(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - 25 = 11$, you are defining a contour at height $z=11$. This contour traces out a flat circle of radius $r=\\sqrt{25}=5$. The height is the same for all points $(x,y)$ on this circle.\n\n![3D plot of the paraboloid $z=g(x,y)=x^2+y^2-25$.](FiguresPNG/multivariateimplicitdifferentiation-fig1-1.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"60%\"}\n\n![Contour plot of the centre of the paraboloid with the contour at height $z=11$ in yellow.](FiguresPNG/multivariateimplicitdifferentiation-fig2-2.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"60%\"}\n:::\n\n# Implicit differentiation for one variable\n\nIn \\[Guide: Introduction to implicit differentiation\\], you saw how the method of implicit differentiation works. This section looks at an alternative way of thinking about this when considering partial differentiation.\n\nOften it is more convenient to redefine $z = g(x,y) = \\text{constant}$ to be $z = f(x,y) = 0$ (a contour of zero height) by including the constant as part of the function. $$\\begin{aligned}\n&g(x,y) = \\text{constant} \\\\[0.5em]\n&g(x,y) - \\text{constant} = 0 \\\\[0.5em]\n&f(x,y) = 0\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nWith the example of the paraboloid, this would involve redefining the circular contour of radius $5$ and height $11$ from $z = g(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - 25 = 11$ to a circular contour of radius $6$ and height $0$ as $z = f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - 36 = 0$.\n\nSince the height $z$ is constant (at zero) along the contour, the height neither increases nor decreases as you walk along the contour so the rate of change of height is zero. This means the derivative of $z$ with respect to the independent variable $t$ is defined as $$\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}z}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0$$\n\nThis result can be substituted into the multivariate chain rule: $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}z}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= \\dfrac{\\partial{z}}{\\partial{x}}\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\dfrac{\\partial{z}}{\\partial{y}}\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\\\[0.5em]\n0 &= \\dfrac{\\partial{z}}{\\partial{x}}\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\dfrac{\\partial{z}}{\\partial{y}}\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nSince $f(x,y) = 0$, the total derivative of the function with respect to $x$ must also be zero: $$\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x} f(x,y) =  \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}x} = 0$$\n\nThe function $f(x,y)$ depends on both of the dependent variables $x$ and $y$, so when you differentiate with respect to $x$ you must use the multivariate chain rule. $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}x} &= \\dfrac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{x}}\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}x} + \\dfrac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{y}}\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\\\[0.5em]\n0 &= \\dfrac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{x}} + \\dfrac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{y}}\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x}\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe final step is to rearrange for $\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x}$. $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\dfrac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{y}}\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x} &= -\\dfrac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{x}} \\\\[0.5em]\n\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x} &= - \\dfrac{\\partial{f} / \\partial{x}}{\\partial{f} / \\partial{y}}\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThis final result is the multivariate equation for implicit differentiation (for one dependent variable) with the chain rule.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Implicit differentiation with the chain rule\n\nIf $f(x,y) = 0$ defines $y=y(x)$ implicitly then $$\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x} = - \\dfrac{\\partial{f} / \\partial{x}}{\\partial{f} / \\partial{y}} = - \\dfrac{f_x(x,y)}{f_y(x,y)}$$\n:::\n\n::: callout-warning\nSince $\\dfrac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{y}}$ appears on the denominator, this requires $\\dfrac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{y}} \\neq 0$.\n:::\n\nTo apply this equation, the function must be written in the form $f(x,y) = \\textsf{terms in } x \\textsf{ and } y = 0$.\n\nThe following example shows how to use implicit differentiation to find $\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x}$ when $y=y(x)$ is defined implicitly by $f(x,y) = x^3y + 2y^2 - 5x^2 - 4y + 7 = 0$.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 4\n\nLet $z = f(x,y) = x^3y + 2y^2 - 5x^2 - 4y + 7 = 0$ and define $y=y(x)$ implicitly.\n\nDetermine $\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x}$.\n\nFirstly, calculate the derivatives required for the implicit differentiation equation. $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\dfrac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{x}} &= 3x^2y - 10x \\\\[0.5em]\n\\dfrac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{y}} &= x^3 + 4y - 4\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nApply the implicit differentiation equation and substitute for the derivatives. $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x} &= - \\dfrac{\\partial{f} / \\partial{x}}{\\partial{f} / \\partial{y}} \\\\[0.5em]\n\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x} &= - \\dfrac{3x^2y-10x}{x^3+4y-4}\n\\end{aligned}$$\n:::\n\nThe important point is that implicit differentiation allows you to find $\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x}$ without solving explicitly for $y$, which is often difficult or impossible to do.\n\nWhile it may still be possible to solve $x^3y + 2y^2 - 5x^2 - 4y + 7 = 0$ for $y$ using standard techniques, it could still be quite difficult to find a way to write $y$ explicitly in terms of $x$. In many cases like these, using the implicit differentiation rule is more practical.\n\n# Implicit differentiation for two or more variables\n\nSuppose you have a function $z = z(x,y)$ of variables $x$ and $y$ that is defined by $$4x^2 + 3y^2z^2 - 5x^2y + 2z^3 - 7 = 0$$\n\nIt is often impractical to express $z$ as an explicit function of $x$ and $y$. Instead, the function is defined implicitly by an equation of the form $$w = f(x,y,z) = 0$$\n\nThis defines a surface in four-dimensional space. Since this surface implicitly defines $z$ in terms of $x$ and $y$, you can use the chain rule to differentiate implicitly and find the partial derivatives $\\dfrac{\\partial{z}}{\\partial{x}}$ and $\\dfrac{\\partial{z}}{\\partial{y}}$ without explicitly solving for $z$.\n\nSince the function value $w$ is constant (at zero) along the contour, the function value neither increases nor decreases as you move along the contour so the rate of change of the function value $w$ is zero. This means the partial derivatives of $w$ with respect to the independent variables $x$ and $y$ are defined as $$\\dfrac{\\partial{w}}{\\partial{x}} = 0 \\qquad \\textsf{and} \\qquad \\dfrac{\\partial{w}}{\\partial{y}} = 0$$\n\nYou can now use the chain rule to differentiate implicitly with $z=z(x,y)$ using a similar method to the last section.\n\nApply the multivariate chain rule to differentiate $w$ with respect to $x$. $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\dfrac{\\partial{w}}{\\partial{x}} &= \\dfrac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{x}}\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}x} + \\dfrac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{z}}\\dfrac{\\partial{z}}{\\partial{x}} \\\\[0.5em]\n0 &= \\dfrac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{x}} + \\dfrac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{z}}\\dfrac{\\partial{z}}{\\partial{x}}\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe next step is to rearrange for $\\dfrac{\\partial{z}}{\\partial{x}}$. $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\dfrac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{z}}\\dfrac{\\partial{z}}{\\partial{x}} &= -\\dfrac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{x}} \\\\[0.5em]\n\\dfrac{\\partial{z}}{\\partial{x}} &= - \\dfrac{\\partial{f} / \\partial{x}}{\\partial{f} / \\partial{z}}\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nApply the multivariate chain rule to differentiate $w$ with respect to $y$. $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\dfrac{\\partial{w}}{\\partial{y}} &= \\dfrac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{y}}\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}y} + \\dfrac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{z}}\\dfrac{\\partial{z}}{\\partial{y}} \\\\[0.5em]\n0 &= \\dfrac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{y}} + \\dfrac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{z}}\\dfrac{\\partial{z}}{\\partial{y}}\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe next step is to rearrange for $\\dfrac{\\partial{z}}{\\partial{y}}$. $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\dfrac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{z}}\\dfrac{\\partial{z}}{\\partial{y}} &= -\\dfrac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{y}} \\\\[0.5em]\n\\dfrac{\\partial{z}}{\\partial{y}} &= - \\dfrac{\\partial{f} / \\partial{y}}{\\partial{f} / \\partial{z}}\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\n::: callout-note\n## Implicit differentiation with the chain rule\n\nIf $f(x,y,z) = 0$ defines $z = z(x,y)$ implicitly then $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\dfrac{\\partial{z}}{\\partial{x}} &= - \\dfrac{\\partial{f} / \\partial{x}}{\\partial{f} / \\partial{z}} = - \\dfrac{f_x(x,y)}{f_z(x,y)} \\\\[0.5em]\n\\dfrac{\\partial{z}}{\\partial{y}} &= - \\dfrac{\\partial{f} / \\partial{y}}{\\partial{f} / \\partial{z}} = - \\dfrac{f_y(x,y)}{f_z(x,y)}\n\\end{aligned}$$\n:::\n\n::: callout-warning\nSince $\\dfrac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{z}}$ appears on the denominator of both equations, this requires $\\dfrac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{z}} \\neq 0$.\n:::\n\nTo apply this equation, the function must be written in the form $f(x,y,z) = \\textsf{terms in } x \\textsf{, } y \\textsf{ and } z = 0$\n\nThe following example shows you how to use implicit differentiation to find $\\dfrac{\\partial{z}}{\\partial{x}}$ and $\\dfrac{\\partial{z}}{\\partial{y}}$ when $z=z(x,y)$ is defined implicitly by $f(x,y,z) = 4x^2 + 3y^2z^2 - 5x^2y + 2z^3 - 7 = 0$.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 5\n\nLet $w = f(x,y,z) = 4x^2 + 3y^2z^2 - 5x^2y + 2z^3 - 7 = 0$ and define $z=z(x,y)$ implicitly.\n\nDetermine $\\dfrac{\\partial{z}}{\\partial{x}}$ and $\\dfrac{\\partial{z}}{\\partial{y}}$.\n\nFirst, calculate the derivatives required for the implicit differentiation equations. $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\dfrac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{x}} &= 8x - 10xy \\\\[0.5em]\n\\dfrac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{y}} &= 6yz^2 - 5x^2 \\\\[0.5em]\n\\dfrac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{z}} &= 4x^2 + 6y^2z + 6z^2\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nApply the implicit differentiation equation and substitute for the derivatives.\n\nCalculate the partial derivative of $z$ with respect to $x$. $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\dfrac{\\partial{z}}{\\partial{x}} &= - \\dfrac{\\partial{f} / \\partial{x}}{\\partial{f} / \\partial{z}} \\\\[0.5em]\n\\dfrac{\\partial{z}}{\\partial{x}} &= - \\dfrac{8x - 10xy}{4x^2 + 6y^2z + 6z^2}\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nCalculate the partial derivative of $z$ with respect to $y$. $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\dfrac{\\partial{z}}{\\partial{y}} &= - \\dfrac{\\partial{f} / \\partial{y}}{\\partial{f} / \\partial{z}} \\\\[0.5em]\n\\dfrac{\\partial{z}}{\\partial{y}} &= - \\dfrac{6yz^2 - 5x^2}{4x^2 + 6y^2z + 6z^2}\n\\end{aligned}$$\n:::\n\nImplicit differentiation allows you to find $\\dfrac{\\partial{z}}{\\partial{x}}$ and $\\dfrac{\\partial{z}}{\\partial{y}}$ without solving explicitly for $z$ which is often difficult or impossible to do.\n\nWhile it may still be possible to solve $4x^2 + 3y^2z^2 - 5x^2y + 2z^3 - 7 = 0$ for $z$ using standard techniques, it could still be quite difficult to find a way to write $z$ explicitly in terms of $x$ and $y$.
