Therefore, it is highly recommended that you read [Guide: Introduction to vectors](introductiontovectors.qmd). You should be able to understand the components of a vector and be able to work out the magnitude of a vector before continuing.*\n\n## What is the scalar product? {-}\n\nWhen working with vectors, you want to be able to combine them in order to solve problems involving vectors in three dimensional space. This may extend to finding the angle between two vectors or testing to see if two vectors are perpendicular or not. The tool you need for these endeavours is the **scalar product**.\n\nThe **scalar product** also known as the **dot product** (due to the symbol for the operation) or **inner product** (as one of the many inner products that exist in linear mathematics), essentially measures how much two vectors are pointing in the same direction. This measure can then be used to find the angle between two vectors.\n\nAs you might imagine, this is an important tool if you are working with vectors in three dimensional space. The scalar product has many applications in geometry, multivariable calculus, physics, and chemistry.\n\nThis guide will give both the algebraic and geometric definition of the scalar product, explain certain properties of the operation, show you how to find the angle between two vectors using the scalar product, and bring awareness to special cases that arise, such as being able to determine whether or not two vectors are perpendicular.\n\nAs with all other introductory guides to vectors (including [Guide: Introduction to vectors](introductiontovectors.qmd) and [Guide: Vector addition and scalar multiplication](addandsm.qmd)), the vectors in this guide are exclusively **three dimensional**.\n\n# Algebraic definition {-}\n\nWorking out the scalar product of two vectors algebraically is based on their components. \n\n::: callout-note\n## Algebraic definition of the scalar product\n\nLet $\\mathbf{a} = a_1 \\mathbf{i} + a_2 \\mathbf{j} + a_3 \\mathbf{k}$ and\n$\\mathbf{b} = b_1 \\mathbf{i} + b_2 \\mathbf{j} + b_3 \\mathbf{k}$ be two vectors. The **scalar product** of $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$, written as $\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b}$, is given by $$\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b} = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + a_3b_3.$$\n\nSimilarly, in column notation $\\mathbf{a}= \\begin{bmatrix}a_1\\\\ a_2 \\\\a_3\\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{b} =\\begin{bmatrix}b_1\\\\ b_2 \\\\b_3\\end{bmatrix}$, then:\n\n$$\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = \\begin{bmatrix}a_1\\\\ a_2 \\\\a_3\\end{bmatrix}\\cdot\\begin{bmatrix}b_1\\\\ b_2 \\\\b_3\\end{bmatrix} = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + a_3b_3$$\n\n<!-- This may also be written, using sigma notation, as $$\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\sum^n_{i=1}\\,u_i v_i$$ -->\n:::\n\n<!-- As the name suggests, the scalar product of two vectors is a scalar. It is important to be able to calculate the scalar product of vectors of all dimensions. -->\n\nThe most important thing to take away from this definition is the following:\n\n::: callout-warning\nThe output of the scalar product of two vectors is a **scalar**. So if you are working out the scalar product of two vectors and your answer is either a column vector or contains $\\mathbf{i},\\mathbf{j},\\mathbf{k}$, then your answer is **incorrect** and should be recalculated.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 1\n\nTake $\\mathbf{a}=\\begin{bmatrix}3\\\\5\\\\1\\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{b} =\\begin{bmatrix}2\\\\7\\\\2\\end{bmatrix}$, then the scalar product is $$\\begin{bmatrix}3\\\\ 5 \\\\1\\end{bmatrix}\\cdot\\begin{bmatrix}2\\\\ 7 \\\\2\\end{bmatrix} = (3)(2) + (5)(7) + (1)(2) = 6+35+2 = 43$$\n:::\n\n<!-- ::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"} -->\n<!-- ## Example 2 -->\n\n<!-- Take $\\mathbf{u}=\\begin{bmatrix}10\\\\13\\\\3\\\\2\\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{v} =\\begin{bmatrix}5\\\\1\\\\20\\\\1\\end{bmatrix}$, then the scalar product is $$\\begin{bmatrix}10\\\\ 13 \\\\3\\\\2\\end{bmatrix}\\cdot\\begin{bmatrix}5\\\\ 1 \\\\20\\\\1\\end{bmatrix} = (10)(5)+(13)(1)+(3)(20)+(2)(1)=50+13+60+2 = 125 $$ -->\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 2\n\nTake $\\mathbf{a}=\\begin{bmatrix}-1\\\\7\\\\1\\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{b} =\\begin{bmatrix}-1\\\\-1\\\\2\\end{bmatrix}$, then the scalar product is $$\\begin{bmatrix}-1\\\\ 7 \\\\1\\end{bmatrix}\\cdot\\begin{bmatrix}-1\\\\ -1 \\\\2\\end{bmatrix} = (-1)(-1) + (7)(-1) + (1)(2) = 1-7+2 = -4$$\n:::\n\n::: callout-important\nNotice from Example 2 that the scalar product of two vectors can be a **negative number**.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 3\n\nTake $\\mathbf{u}=4\\mathbf{i}+2\\mathbf{j}+\\mathbf{k}$ and $\\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{i}-\\mathbf{j}+3\\mathbf{k}$, then $$\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}=(4\\mathbf{i}+2\\mathbf{j}+\\mathbf{k})\\cdot(\\mathbf{i}-\\mathbf{j}+3\\mathbf{k})=(4)(1)+(2)(-1)+(1)(3)=5$$  \n:::\n\n\n# Geometric definition {-}\n\nIt was mentioned in the introduction that the scalar product can be used to measure how much of a vector points in the direction of another. However, there is nothing in the algebraic definition to suggest *why* this is the case. The second definition of the scalar product relies on the magnitude of the two vectors and the smallest angle between them. \n\n::: callout-note\n## Geometric defintion of the scalar product\n\nFor two vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$, their scalar product $\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b}$ can also be defined as follows:\n$$\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b}=|\\mathbf{a}||\\mathbf{b}|\\cos(\\theta)$$ where $|\\mathbf{a}|,|\\mathbf{b}|$ are the magnitudes of $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ respectively and $\\theta$ (pronounced 'theta') is the **smallest** angle between $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$.\n:::\n\nYou can use this definition to find the angle between two (non-zero) vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$. Since these vectors are non-zero, both $|\\mathbf{a}|$ and $|\\mathbf{b}|$ are non-zero. You can then divide both sides of the geometric definition of the scalar product to get $$\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b}}{|\\mathbf{a}||\\mathbf{b}|}.$$ \n\nSince $\\theta$ is the smallest angle between $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ by definition, it follows that $0^\\circ\\leq \\theta \\leq 180^\\circ$ in degrees, or $0\\leq \\theta \\leq \\pi$ in radians. This means that you can safely use the inverse trigonometric function $\\cos^{-1}$ in this case. (See [Guide: Inverse trigonometric functions] for more.)\n\nLet's now put this definition to use!\n\n<!-- ::: {.callout-warning}  -->\n<!-- ## WARNING -->\n<!-- In the above, the vectors cannot be **anti-parallel** or **parallel** and must be of non-zero length. The special cases in which they do not follow these conditions are dealt with below. -->\n<!-- :::  -->\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 4\nTake $\\mathbf{a}=\\begin{bmatrix}3\\\\5\\\\1\\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{b} =\\begin{bmatrix}2\\\\7\\\\2\\end{bmatrix}$, as in Example 1. In that example, it was calculated that $\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b} = 43$. So you can use the above definition to calculate the smallest angle $\\theta$ between the two vectors.\n\n$$\\cos(\\theta)=\\frac{\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b}}{|\\mathbf{a}||\\mathbf{b}|}=\\frac{43}{\\left(\\sqrt{3^2+5^2+1^2}\\right)\\left(\\sqrt{2^2+7^2+2^2}\\right)}=\\frac{43}{\\sqrt{35}\\sqrt{57}}$$\nYou will need a calculator or computer to work out the value of $\\theta$ via $\\cos^{-1}$. To avoid rounding errors, you should find the inverse cosine of this exact value in your calculator or computer. Doing this gives \n\\begin{align*}\n\\theta=\\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{43}{\\sqrt{35}\\sqrt{57}}\\right) = {15.695^\\circ} = 0.274\\textsf{ rad}\\tag{\\textsf{to 3dp}}\n\\end{align*}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 5\n\nTake $\\mathbf{a}=\\begin{bmatrix}-1\\\\7\\\\1\\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{b} =\\begin{bmatrix}-1\\\\-1\\\\2\\end{bmatrix}$, then the scalar product is $$\\begin{bmatrix}-1\\\\ 7 \\\\1\\end{bmatrix}\\cdot\\begin{bmatrix}-1\\\\ -1 \\\\2\\end{bmatrix} = (-1)(-1) + (7)(-1) + (1)(2) = 1-7+2 = -4$$\n\nTake $\\mathbf{a}=\\begin{bmatrix}-1\\\\7\\\\1\\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{b} =\\begin{bmatrix}-1\\\\-1\\\\2\\end{bmatrix}$, as in Example 2. It was calculated then that the scalar product between them is $-4$. So, the angle between them can be calculated as follows:\n$$\\cos(\\theta)=\\frac{\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b}}{|\\mathbf{a}||\\mathbf{b}|}=\\frac{-4}{\\left(\\sqrt{(-1)^2+7^2+1^2}\\right)\\left(\\sqrt{(-1)^2+(-1)^2+2^2}\\right)}=\\frac{-4}{\\sqrt{51}\\sqrt{6}}$$\nand so, following the advice from Example 4 above, you can work out the angle to be\n\\begin{align*}\n\\theta=\\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{-4}{\\sqrt{51}\\sqrt{6}}\\right) = {103.218^\\circ} = 1.802\\textsf{ rad}\\tag{\\textsf{to 3dp}}\n\\end{align*}\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nIf the scalar product of two vectors is positive, then the smallest angle $\\theta$ between the two vectors is acute (that is, $0^\\circ\\leq\\theta < 90^\\circ$ or $0 \\leq \\theta < \\pi/2$). If the scalar product of two vectors is negative, then the smallest angle $\\theta$ between the two vectors is obtuse (that is, $90^\\circ < \\theta \\leq 180^\\circ$ or $\\pi/2 < \\theta \\leq \\pi$).\n\nIf the scalar product of two vectors is $0$, then the two vectors are perpendicular; see below for more on this.\n:::\n\n# Properties of the scalar product\n\nMuch like in [Guide: Vector addition and scalar multiplication](addandsm.qmd), the scalar product has many useful properties, both from its algebraic and its geometric definitions.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nFor more information as to **why** the following properties are true, please see [Proof sheet: The scalar product](../proofsheets/ps-scalarproduct.qmd) for more details.\n:::\n\n<!-- ::: {.callout-note} -->\n<!-- ## Definition of Commutative, Distributive -->\n\n<!-- An operation is **commutative** if it gives the same result whatever order the values are in. For example, $ab = ba$, so multiplication is commutative. -->\n\n<!-- An operation is **distributive** (under addition) if $a (b+c)=(ab)+(ac)$.  -->\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n(1) The scalar product is **commutative**, so for all vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$: $$\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b}=\\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{a}.$$\n\n(2) The scalar product of any vector $\\mathbf{a}$ with the zero vector $\\mathbf{0}$ is 0, so: $$\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{0}=0$$\n\n(3)  The scalar product is **distributive**, so for all vectors $\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b},\\mathbf{c}$, it follows that: $$\\mathbf{a}\\cdot (\\mathbf{b}+\\mathbf{c}) = \\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b}+\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{c}$$\n\n(4) Scalar multiplication is preserved in the scalar product. So if $\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b}$ are vectors and $\\lambda$ (pronounced 'lambda') is a scalar, then \n$$(\\lambda\\mathbf{a})\\cdot\\mathbf{b}=\\lambda(\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b})$$\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 6\n\nTake $\\mathbf{a}=\\begin{bmatrix}3\\\\5\\\\1\\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{b} =\\begin{bmatrix}2\\\\7\\\\2\\end{bmatrix}$, as in Example 1. Then you know $\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b}= 43$. You can check $\\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{a}$ to verify the commutative property (1) of the scalar product: $$\\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{a}=\\begin{bmatrix}2\\\\7\\\\2\\end{bmatrix}\\cdot\\begin{bmatrix}3\\\\5\\\\1\\end{bmatrix}=(2)(3)+(7)(5)+(2)(1)=6+35+2=43$$ So $\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b}=\\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{a}$ as expected.\n\nIn addition, you can work out $(3\\mathbf{a})\\cdot\\mathbf{b}$ by using property (4) without much further calculation. Using the property and the fact that $\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b}= 43$ gives: $$(3\\mathbf{a})\\cdot\\mathbf{b} = 3(\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b}) = 3(43) = 129.$$\n:::\n\nThe following further properties are consequences of the geometric definition of the scalar product. \n\n(5) The scalar product of a vector $\\mathbf{a}$ with itself is the square of its magnitude:\n$$\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{a}=|\\mathbf{a}|^2$$\n\n(6) If two vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ are **parallel** (so $\\mathbf{a}$ is a scalar multiple of $\\mathbf{b}$ by a positive scalar; see [Guide: Vector addition and scalar multiplication](addandsm.qmd)), then\n$$\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b}=|\\mathbf{a}||\\mathbf{b}|.$$ Similarly, if $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ are **anti-parallel** (so $\\mathbf{a}$ is a scalar multiple of $\\mathbf{b}$ by a negative scalar; see [Guide: Vector addition and scalar multiplication](addandsm.qmd)), then \n$$\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b}=-|\\mathbf{a}||\\mathbf{b}|.$$\n(7) If two non-zero vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ are perpendicular, then their scalar product $\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b}$ is equal to $0$. On the other hand, if the scalar product of two non-zero vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ is equal to $0$, then $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ are perpendicular.\n\nOf these, property (7) is incredibly interesting. You can even use this property to solve some vector equations involving the scalar product. \n\n<!-- This is because the angle between the two vectors is $90^\\circ$ and as $\\cos(90)=0$, $$\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}=|\\mathbf{u}||\\mathbf{v}|\\cos(90)=0$$. -->\n\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 7\n\nTake $\\mathbf{a}=\\begin{bmatrix}14\\\\2\\\\100\\end{bmatrix}$, then $$\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{a}=14^2+2^2+100^2=10200.$$ The magnitude of $\\mathbf{a}$ is $$|\\mathbf{a}|=\\sqrt{14^2+2^2+100^2}=\\sqrt{10200}$$ and so, $$|\\mathbf{a}|^2=\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{a}$$ as you would expect!\n:::\n\n<!-- ## Proof of commutativity -->\n\n<!-- You've just seen one example showing that the scalar product is commutative. How about for all vectors? Let $\\mathbf{u} = \\begin{bmatrix}u_1\\\\ \\vdots \\\\u_n\\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{v} =\\begin{bmatrix}v_1\\\\ \\vdots \\\\v_n\\end{bmatrix}$, then $$\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix}u_1\\\\ \\vdots \\\\u_n\\end{bmatrix}\\cdot\\begin{bmatrix}v_1\\\\ \\vdots \\\\v_n\\end{bmatrix} = u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + ... + u_nv_n = v_1u_1 + v_2u_2+...+v_nu_n$$\\ since multiplication is commutative (that is $u_1v_1=v_1u_1$). And, $$\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{u}=\\begin{bmatrix}v_1\\\\ \\vdots \\\\v_n\\end{bmatrix}\\cdot\\begin{bmatrix}u_1\\\\ \\vdots \\\\u_n\\end{bmatrix}=v_1u_1 + v_2u_2+...+v_nu_n=\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}$$ Hence, the scalar product is commutative. -->\n\n<!-- ## Special Cases... -->\n\n<!-- There are a few specific cases that you need to be careful with when dealing with the scalar product.

By working out the scalar product of $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ and setting $\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b} = 0$, you can find the value of $z$ for which $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ are perpendicular. Doing this gives\n$$\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b}=\\begin{bmatrix}2\\\\1\\\\z\\end{bmatrix}\\cdot\\begin{bmatrix}5\\\\6\\\\1\\end{bmatrix}=(2)(5)+(1)(6)+(z)(1)=10+6+z=16+z$$\nSetting this scalar product to be zero allows you to find the value of $z$ such that $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ are perpendicular.
