It shows how the change in one variable affects the whole function by considering how the intermediate variables change. It is useful in modelling systems where one quantity depends on several factors. For example, climate models use variables like temperature, humidity and ocean currents to predict weather patterns.\ncategories:\n  - Calculus\nimage: FiguresPNG/introtodifferentiation-image.png\ndraft: true\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Before reading this guide, it is recommended that you read [Guide: Introduction to partial differentiation](introtopartialdifferentiation.qmd) and \\[Guide: The chain rule\\].*\n\n# What is the multivariate chain rule?\n\nAs seen in \\[Guide: The chain rule\\], the chain rule tells you how to differentiate a function $y=f(x)$ with respect to another variable $t$ when $x$ depends on $t$.\n$$\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\n\nThis rule can be extended to functions of multiple variables through the **multivariate chain rule**. The extended rule tells you how to compute derivatives of composite functions (functions of functions) involving multiple variables. It allows you to track how changes in **independent variables** influence a final quantity through intermediate variables called **dependent variables**.\n\nThe multivariate chain rule is used in problems involving parametric multivariate functions, such as those describing motion along curved surfaces, transformations in computer graphics, and population models where growth depends on multiple time-varying factors.\n\nBefore moving on, it is important to define what the difference is between dependent and independent variables.\n\n# Dependent and independent variables\n\nWhen a function **depends** on a specific variable, this means that the function is written with the variable in its rule. For example, the function $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$ depends on $x$ and $y$ as the function is written in terms of $x$ and $y$.\n\nA **multivariate (or multivariable) function** is a function that depends on more than one variable.\n\nConsider a multivariate function $w = f(x,y,z) = 2x^2 + xy + 3xz$ where\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nx(s,t) &= s^2 - t \\\\[0.2em]\ny(s,t) &= s^2 + t \\\\[0.2em]\nz(s,t) &= 2s + t^2\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe variables $x$, $y$ and $z$ are referred to as **dependent variables** as they are functions that depend on (can be written in terms of) the variables $s$ and $t$. Even though $x$, $y$ and $z$ are referred to as dependent variables, they are actually functions of the variables $s$ and $t$. In this case, the dependent variables can be written in functional form as $x = x(s,t)$, $y = y(s,t)$ and $z = z(s,t)$ to emphasize dependency.\n\nThe variables $s$ and $t$ are referred to as **independent variables** as they do not depend on any other variables.\n\nOccasionally, the dependent variables in this guide may be referred to as **intermediate variables** since they connect the independent variables $s$ and $t$ to the final quantity $w$.\n\n# Functions of two dependent variables with one independent variable\n\nSuppose you have a function $z = f(x,y)$. Here, $z$ depends on two dependent variables $x$ and $y$, however both $x$ and $y$ are functions of a single independent variable $t$. $$x=x(t) \\quad \\textsf{and} \\quad y=y(t)$$\n\nThis means that, even though $z$ initially looks like a function of two dependent variables $x$ and $y$, it really depends on a single independent variable $t$. You can write $z$ entirely in terms of $t$. $$z = f(x(t),y(t))$$\n\nThe goal is to find $\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}z}{\\mathrm{d}t}$.\n\nYou cannot differentiate $z = f(x,y)$ directly with respect to $t$ because $z$ depends intermediately on both $x$ and $y$. Instead, you need to use the multivariate chain rule.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Multivariate chain rule for functions of one independent variable\n\nLet $z=f(x,y)$ where $f$ is a differentiable function of $x$ and $y$. Also let $x=x(t)$ and $y=y(t)$ be differentiable functions of $t$.\n\nThe function $z$ can then be differentiated with respect to $t$ according to\n$$\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}z}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\dfrac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\dfrac{\\partial z}{\\partial y}\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\n\n:::\n\n::: callout-important\nThe left-most derivative $\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}z}{\\mathrm{d}t}$ is written with a straight $\\mathrm{d}$ as $z=z(t)$ is considered a function of $t$ only, at this stage. Here, $z$ is written using the expressions for $x$ and $y$ in terms of $t$.\n\nDerivatives such as $\\dfrac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}$ and $\\dfrac{\\partial z}{\\partial y}$ are written with a curly $\\partial$ as $z$ is a function that depends on two variables $x$ and $y$.\n\nDerivatives such as $\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t}$ and $\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}t}$ are written with a straight $\\mathrm{d}$ as $x$ is a function that depends only on a single variable $t$.\n:::\n\nAs $t$ changes, both dependent variables $x$ and $y$ change as they are both functions of the independent variable $t$. This causes $z$ to change as it is a function of the variables $x$ and $y$ which are also changing.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 1\n\nLet $z = f(x,y) = x^3 + y^3$ where $x=3t^2$ and $y=\\cos(t)$. Use the multivariate chain rule to find $\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}z}{\\mathrm{d}t}$.\n\nFirst, calculate the derivatives required for the multivariate chain rule.\n$$\\begin{array}{lcl}\n\\dfrac{\\partial z}{\\partial x} = 3x^2 & \\quad &\n\\dfrac{\\partial z}{\\partial y} = 3y^2 \\\\[0.5em]\n\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 6t & \\quad &\n\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\sin(t)\n\\end{array}$$\n\nYou need to substitute the derivatives into the multivariate chain rule, then substitute for $x=3t^2$ and $y=\\cos(t)$.\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}z}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= \\dfrac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\dfrac{\\partial z}{\\partial y}\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\\\[0.5em]\n&= (3x^2)(6t) + (3y^2)(-\\sin(t)) \\\\[0.5em]\n&= 3(3t^2)^2(6t) + 3(\\cos(t))^2(-\\sin(t)) \\\\[0.5em]\n&= 162t^5 - 3\\sin(t)\\cos^2(t)\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\n:::\n\n::: callout-important\nMake sure that your final answer is always expressed only in terms of independent variables. Your final answer should not include any intermediate variables such as $x$ and $y$ in this example.\n:::\n\n# Functions of two dependent variables with two independent variables {.unnumbered}\n\nSuppose you have a function $z=f(x,y)$.
