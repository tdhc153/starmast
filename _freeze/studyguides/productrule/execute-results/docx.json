This guide introduces the product rule and explains examples of where it is used. \ncategories:\n  - Calculus\nimage: FiguresPNG/introtodifferentiation-image.png\ndraft: true\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Before reading this guide, it is recommended that you read [Guide: Introduction to differentiation and the derivative](introtodifferentiation.qmd).*\n\n# What is the product rule? {-}\n\n[MOTIVATION AND BLURB]\n\nThis guide will look at the product rule for differentiation; where it comes from, how it can be used, and how you can apply its techniques to functions that you may be familiar with. \n\nThe summary table of key derivatives from [Guide: Introduction to differentiation and the derivative](introtodifferentiation.qmd) is reproduced here for reference:\n\n| Function $f(x)$ | Derivative $f'(x)$ | Notes |\n|:-----------|:-------------------|:--------|\n| $f(x) = c$ | $f'(x) = 0$ |  |\n| $f(x) = ax + b$ | $f'(x) = a$ | |\n| $f(x) = ax^n$ | $f'(x) = anx^{n-1}$ | $n \\neq 0$ |\n| $f(x) = ae^{bx}$ | $f'(x) = abe^{bx}$ |  |\n| $f(x) = a\\sin(bx)$ | $f'(x) = ab\\cos(bx)$ |  |\n| $f(x) = a\\cos(bx)$ | $f'(x) = -ab\\sin(bx)$ |  |\n| $f(x) = a\\ln(bx)$ | $f'(x) = \\dfrac{a}{x}$ |  |\n\n# Statement of the product rule\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## The product rule\n\nLet $u(x)$ and $v(x)$ be two differentiable functions. Then the **product rule** says that\n$$(uv)'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(u(x)v(x)\\right) = u(x)v'(x) + u'(x)v(x)$$\nthat is, the derivative of the product of $u(x)$ and $v(x)$ is equal to the product of $u(x)$ and the derivative of $v(x)$, plus the product of $v(x)$ and the derivative of $u(x)$.\n\nThis can also be written as $$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(u(x)v(x)\\right) = u\\frac{\\textrm{d}v}{\\textrm{d}x} + v\\frac{\\textrm{d}u}{\\textrm{d}x}.$$\n\n:::\n\nSometimes $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are written instead of $u(x)$ and $v(x)$ in the statement of the product rule. The reason that $u(x)$ and $v(x)$ is used here is that sometimes the product function is called $f(x)$; and you then can't use it again!\n\nIt does not matter which function you pick to be $u(x)$ and which function you pick to be $v(x)$; this is because $u(x)v(x) = v(x)u(x)$. \n\nTo see why this really is the derivative of the product of two functions, please see [Proof sheet: Rules of differentiation.]\n\n# Examples\n\n$f(x) = \\ln(x)/x^5$\n\n$f(x) = 4x^4\\cos(4x) + e^{-4x}\\cos(4x)$\n\n$f(x) = e^x\\sin(2x)\\cos(4x)$\n\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 1\n\nWhat is the derivative of $y = x^3e^x$?\n\nIn this case, you have two functions multiplied together to make $y$. The two functions are $u(x) = x^3$ and $v(x) = e^x$. In order to use the product rule on $y$, you could differentiate $u(x)$ and $v(x)$ beforehand and then substitute them into the product rule. Doing this gives\n\n- For $u(x) = x^3$, then $u'(x) = 3x^2$ by the power rule.\n\n- For $v(x) = e^x$, then $v'(x) = e^x$.\n\nPutting these into the statement of the product rule gives\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\textrm{d}y}{\\textrm{d}x} &= u(x)v'(x) + u'(x)v(x)\\\\[0.5em]\n&= (x^3)(e^x) + (3x^2)(e^x)\\\\[0.5em]\n&= x^3e^x + 3x^2e^x\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nand this is your answer. You could also factorise the answer if you wanted to to get $y'(x) = (x^3 + 3x^2)e^x$.\n\n:::\n\nHere's another example of the product rule, which is included solely for a chance to remember the signs for the derivatives of $\\sin(x)$ and $\\cos(x)$!\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 2\n\nFind the derivative of the function $f(x) = 2\\sin(x)\\cos(x)$.\n\nIn this case, there are two options. You can either \n\n- use the constant rule to take the $2$ out and differentiate $\\sin(x)\\cos(x)$ using the product rule, or\n- take $u(x) = 2\\sin(x)$ and $v(x) = \\cos(x)$ and differentiate directly. \n\nLet's do the first of these. To use the product rule take $u(x) = \\sin(x)$ and $v(x) = \\cos(x)$. Then $u'(x) = \\cos(x)$ and $v'(x) = -\\sin(x)$. Therefore, using the product rule gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\textrm{d}}{\\textrm{d}x}\\left(\\sin(x)\\cos(x)\\right) &= u(x)v'(x) + u'(x)v(x)\\\\[0.5em]\n&= (\\sin(x))(-\\sin(x)) + (\\cos(x))(\\cos(x))\\\\[0.5em]\n&= \\cos^2(x) - \\sin^2(x)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTherefore, the derivative of $f(x) = 2\\sin(x)\\cos(x)$ is $$f'(x) = 2\\left(\\cos^2(x) - \\sin^2(x)\\right).$$\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\nYou don't always need the product rule to differentiate the product of two functions if that product of two functions can be expressed in a different way. \n\nFor instance, the function in Example 2 is $f(x) = 2\\sin(x)\\cos(x)$, which by a trigonometric identity is equal to $f(x) = \\sin(2x)$. (See [Guide: Trigonometric identities (radians)](trigonometricidentities-radians.qmd) for more.) You can then differentiate $\\sin(2x)$ by the rules above to get $2\\cos(2x)$. By trigonometric identities, this is also equal to $2\\left(\\cos^2(x) - \\sin^2(x)\\right)$, which is the same answer as in Example 2. \n\nThis shows you should explore all potential avenues before starting to use differentiation techniques.\n\n:::\n\nHere's an example which combines two separate differentiation rules; both the sum rule and the product rule. \n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 3\n\nFind the derivative of the function $f(x) = e^x\\sqrt{x} + x^3$.\n\nHere, you could use the sum rule for differentiation to write $$\\frac{\\textrm{d}}{\\textrm{d}x}\\left(f(x)\\right) = \\frac{\\textrm{d}}{\\textrm{d}x}\\left(e^x\\sqrt{x}\\right) + \\frac{\\textrm{d}}{\\textrm{d}x}\\left(x^3\\right)$$\n\nYou can then rewrite the function as $$f(x) = x^{-4} + 4\\sin(x) - \\cos(4x)$$ and use the familiar rules of differentiation above. Using the results above with $n = -4$, the derivative of $x^{-4}$ is $-4x^{-4-1} = -4x^{-5}$. The derivative of $4\\sin(x)$ is $4(\\cos(x)) = 4\\cos(x)$. The derivative of $\\cos(4x)$ is $-4\\sin(4x)$. Taking care of your signs you can write the derivative of $\\dfrac{1}{x^4} + 4\\cos(x) - \\sin(4x)$ as $$f'(x) = -4x^{-5} + 4\\cos(x) - (-4\\sin(4x)) = -4x^{-5} + 4\\cos(x) + 4\\sin(4x).$$\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 4\n\nDetermine the behaviour of the function $f(x) = 2\\ln(3x) - x$ when $x = 1$. \n\nHere, you will first need to differentiate the function $f(x)$ to find $f'(x)$. Then, you will need to evaluate the derivative $f'(x)$ when $x = 1$ to see how the function behaves.\n\nUsing your rules of differentiation as you found above, you can say that the derivative of $2\\ln(3x)$ is $2/x$, and the derivative of $x$ is $1$. Therefore, the derivative of the function $f(x) = 2\\ln(3x) - x$ is $$f'(x) = \\frac{2}{x} - 1.$$ You can evaluate the derivative $f'(x)$ at $x = 1$ to get $$f'(1) = \\frac{2}{1} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1$$ and so the derivative is positive at $x = 1$. This implies that the function $f(x) = 2\\ln(3x) - x$ is increasing at the point $x = 1$.\n\nIt also means that the gradient of the tangent to the function $f(x)$ at the point $(1,2\\ln(3) - 1)$ is $1$. You can see this in the figure below. \n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 5\n\nDetermine the behaviour of the function $f(x) = 2\\ln(3x) - x$ when $x = 1$. \n\nHere, you will first need to differentiate the function $f(x)$ to find $f'(x)$.
