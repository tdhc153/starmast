They can also be used to represent roots and fractions, such as the square root. The laws of indices make it possible to alter expressions involving powers more quickly than if they were written out whole.\n\nThis guide will introduce six properties of indices: multiplication, division, brackets, powers of zero, negative indices and fractional indices.\n\nIndices are used in many areas of science as a way of representing growth. Economics, biology, demographics and many more fields rely on this sort of growth; chemicals, radioactive waste, and sound are all examples of decay.\n\n::: callout-note\n\n## Definition of an index\n\nThe **index** of a variable (or a constant) is a value that represents how many times a variable is multiplied by itself. Indices are also known as **powers** or **exponents**. It is represented in the form\n\n$$ a^r =\\underbrace{a\\cdot a \\cdot a \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot a}_{r\\textsf{ times}}$$\n\nHere, $a$ is the **base** and $r$ is the **index**. Indices are a shorthand way of writing multiplications of the same number.\n\nAs $a$ multiplied by itself once is $a$, it follows that anything to the power of one is equal to itself $a^1 = a$ and $1$ to the power of anything is $1$; so $1^r=1$ for all real numbers $r$.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 1\n\nSuppose you have\n$$2·2·2·2·2$$ \nyou can write this as '$2$ to the power of $5$'\n$$2^5$$\nSo\n$$2^5 = 2·2·2·2·2 = 32$$\nIn this example, $2$ is the base and $5$ is the index.\n\n:::\n\n# Laws of indices\n\nIn mathematics, you are not restricted to using positive whole numbers for indices. For example, what do these expressions mean: $a^{-1}$ or $a^0$ or $a^{\\tfrac{1}{2}}$? \n\nTo understand these expressions, you can learn rules to help you deal with these strange looking powers. \n\n::: {#law-1-link .callout-note}\n\n## Law 1: Multiplication\n\nIf the two terms have the same base (in this case $a$) and are multiplied together, then their indices $r$ and $s$ are **added** (in this case $r+s$)\n\n$$a^r·a^s = a^{r+s}$$\n\nFor example, suppose you have $3^2$ and you want to multiply it by $3^3$. That is\n$$3^2·3^3 = (3·3) · (3·3·3)$$\nwhich is equal to $3^5$.\n\nTherefore, using Law 1 you can get $$3^2·3^3 = 9·27 = 243 = 3^5 = 3^{2+3}$$\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 2\n\nSimplify the following expression: $x^2y^3· x^3y$.\n\nYou can treat $x$ and $y$ as two separate terms and you are now simplifying $x^2·x^3$ and $y^3·y$. Using Law 1, you can add the indices to get: $x^{2+3}$ and $y^{3+1}$. Remembering to multiply the $x$ and $y$ terms, you then get $$x^2y^3· x^3y = x^{2+3}y^{3+1} = x^5y^4$$\n:::\n\n::: {#law-2-link .callout-note}\n\n## Law 2: Division\n\nIf the two terms have the same base (in this case $a$) and are to be divided, then their indices are **subtracted** (in this case $r-s$)\n\n$$\\dfrac{a^r}{a^s} = a^{r-s}$$ \nFor example suppose you want to divide $2^5$ by $2^3$.\n$$\\dfrac{2^5}{2^3} = \\dfrac{2·2·2·2·2}{2·2·2}$$\nYou can now cancel the common factors of $2$. Three of the $2$'s at the bottom can be cancelled out, so you are left with $$\\dfrac{2·2}{1} = 2^2 = 4$$\nTherefore, you can get\n$$\\dfrac{2^5}{2^3} = 4 = 2^2 = 2^{5-3}$$\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 3\n\nSimplify the following expression: $\\dfrac{x^2y^3}{x^5y}$\n\nYou can treat $\\frac{x^2y^3}{x^5y}$ as the product of two fractions: $\\frac{x^2}{x^5}$ and $\\frac{y^3}{y}$. Using Law 2, you can simplify the fractions to get: $$\\dfrac{x^2}{x^5} = x^{2-5} = x^{-3}$$ and $$\\dfrac{y^3}{y} = y^{3-1} = y^2$$ Remembering to multiply the fractions, you get $$\\dfrac{x^2y^3}{x^5y} = x^{2-5}y^{3-1} = x^{-3}y^2$$ You can notice you have a negative index here; more on those later!\n:::\n\n::: {#law-3-link .callout-note}\n\n## Law 3: brackets\n\nTo raise a value or variable (in this case $a$) presented in index form to another index, **multiply** the indices together ($r$ and $s$)\n$$(a^r)^s = a^{r·s}$$ \nFor example suppose you had $3^2$ and you want to raise it all to the power of $3$; that is $(3^2)^3$, which means $$3^2·3^2·3^2.$$\n[Law 1](#law-1-link) tells you to add the indices together. So you can get $$3^6$$\nBut note that $6$ is $2·3$. This suggests that Law 3 also works. \nTherefore, using Law 3 you can get $$(3^2)^3 = 729 = 3^6 = 3^{2·3}$$\n:::\n\n \n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 4\n\nSimplify the following expression: $(x^2y^3)^4$\n\nUsing Law 3, you get\n$$(x^2y^3)^4 = (x^2)^4·(y^3)^4 = x^{2·4}y^{3·4} = x^8y^{12}$$\n:::\n\n::: {#law-4-link .callout-note}\n\n## Law 4: power of $0$\n\nAny non-zero real number $a$ to the power of zero is equal to one: $$a^0 = 1$$\n\n:::\n\n \n\n::: {callout-warning}\n\n$0^0$ is indeterminate, anything to the power of $0$ is $1$, but $0$ to the power of anything is $0$, so it is not defined.\n:::\n\n \n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 5\n\nSimplify the following expression: $(x^2 + y^5)^0$\n\nUsing Law 4, you can get $$(x^2 + y^5)^0 = 1.$$\n\n:::\n\n \n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## Law 5: negative indices\n\nIf the index is a negative value, then it is reciprocal of the positive index raised to the same variable $$a^{-r} = \\dfrac{1}{a^r}$$ \n\nFor example, suppose you want to divide $2^3$ by $2^7$ $$\\dfrac{2^3}{2^7}=\\dfrac{2·2·2}{2·2·2·2·2·2·2}$$\nAgain, you can find the common factors of $2$. The three $2$'s at the top can be cancelled out, so you are left with $$\\dfrac{2^3}{2^7}=\\dfrac{1}{2·2·2·2}=\\dfrac{1}{2^4}$$\n\nNow consider [Law 2](#law-2-link), you can do the similar calculation by subtracting the indices $$\\dfrac{2^3}{2^7}=2^{3-7}=2^{-4}$$\nYou have done the calculation in two different ways. So you get $$\\dfrac{2^3}{2^7}=2^{3-7}=2^{-4}=\\dfrac{1}{2^4}$$\n\n:::\n\n \n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 6\n\nSimplify the following expression: $(3x+4y)^{-1}$\n\nUsing Law 5, you can get\n$$(3x+4y)^{-1} = \\dfrac{1}{3x+4y}$$\n:::\n\n::: {callout-note}\n\n## Law 6: fractional indices\n\nAn index in the form $1/n$ (where $n$ is a positive whole number) is an $n$th root of $a$. So $$a^{1/n} = \\sqrt[n]{a}.$$\n\nFor example: suppose you found that $$2^r·2^r=2$$\nThis means that multiplying $2^r$ by $2^r$ gives the result $2$. You know that $2=2^1$, so  consider [Law 1](#law-1-link), $2^r·2^r=2^{2r}$. If $2^r·2^r=2$ then you can get $$2^{2r}=2^1$$\nfrom which $r=1$; so $r=\\frac{1}{2}$.This shows that $$2^{\\frac{1}{2}}=\\sqrt[2]{2}=\\sqrt{2}$$\n\nWhat about an expression of the form $a^{r/n}$, where $r$ is a real number and $n$ is a positive whole number? Combining Laws 3 and 6 yields the following: \n$$a^{r/n} = (a^{1/n})^r = (\\sqrt[n]{a})^r$$ \nor equivalently $a^{r/n} = (a^r)^{1/n}$.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 7\n\n(a) Simplify $10000^{(\\frac{3}{4})}$.\n\nUsing Law 7, you can re-express $10000^{\\frac{3}{4}}$ as $(\\sqrt[4]{10000})^3$. Since $10^4=10000$, it follows that $\\sqrt[4]{10000} = 10$. Finally, you can say that $(\\sqrt[4]{10000})^3 = 10^3 = 1000$.\n\n(b) Simplify $27^{-\\frac{2}{3}}$.\n\nUsing Law 7, you can write this expression as $27^{-\\frac{2}{3}} = (\\sqrt[3]{27})^{-2}$. Since the cube root of $27$ is $3$, it follows that  $$ (\\sqrt[3]{27})^{-2} = 3^{-2}$$ which, using Law 5, becomes $3^{-2} = \\frac{1}{3^2} = \\frac{1}{9}.$\n:::\n\nThe first six laws above focused on the index and when the index changes; and in this case, the base remains constant. The final four laws focus on when the base changes and the index remains constant. \n\nThis next law follows from the fact that multiplication is *commutative*; so $ab = ba$ for any two real numbers $a,b$.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Law 7: multiplication of variables with the same indices but different bases\n\nWhen multiplying variables with the same powers you can expand and rewrite them into a nicer format: $$a^r \\cdot b^r = (ab)^r$$\n\nWhere the bases are multiplied together then raised to the $r$th power. For example $$2^3 \\cdot 3^3 = \\underbrace{(2\\cdot 2\\cdot 2)}_{3\\textsf{ times}}\\cdot \\underbrace{(3\\cdot 3\\cdot 3)}_{3\\textsf{ times}}= (2\\cdot 3) \\cdot (2 \\cdot 3)\\cdot (2 \\cdot 3) = (2\\cdot 3)^3.$$\n\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note appearance='simple'}\n## Example 8\n\n(a) Here, you can use Law 7 to say that $(3x)^3 = 3^3\\cdot x^3 = 27x^3$. Notice that $(3x)^3$ is **not** necessarily equal to $3x^3$!\n\n(b) You can use Law 7 in conjunction with other laws. For instance, how would you simplify $(x^3y^2z)^{-2}$? Using Law 7 twice, you can write $$(x^3y^2z)^{-2} = (x^3)^{-2}\\cdot(y^2)^{-2}\\cdot z^{-2}$$ Now, using Law 3, you can write $$(x^3)^{-2}\\cdot(y^2)^{-2}\\cdot z^{-2} = x^{-6}\\cdot y^{-4} \\cdot z^{-2}$$ Finally, using Law 5 you can say that $$(x^3y^2z)^{-2} = x^{-6}\\cdot y^{-4} \\cdot z^{-2} = \\frac{1}{x^6}\\cdot\\frac{1}{y^4}\\cdot\\frac{1}{z^2} = \\frac{1}{x^6y^4z^2}.$$\n\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Law 8: division of variables with the same indices but different bases\n\nWhen dividing variables with the same powers you can expand and rewrite them into a nicer format:\n\n$$\\dfrac{a^r}{b^r} = \\left(\\dfrac{a}{b}\\right)^r$$\n\nWhere the numerator base $a$ is divided by the denominator base $b$ then raised to the $r$th power. For example:\n\n$$\\dfrac{4^4}{5^4} = \\dfrac{\\overbrace{4\\cdot 4\\cdot 4\\cdot 4}^{4\\textsf{ times}}}{\\underbrace{5\\cdot 5\\cdot 5\\cdot 5}_{4\\textsf{ times}}} = \\dfrac{4}{5}\\cdot \\dfrac{4}{5}\\cdot \\dfrac{4}{5}\\cdot \\dfrac{4}{5} = \\left(\\dfrac{4}{5}\\right)^4$$\n\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note appearance='simple'}\n## Example 9\n\nHere, you can use Law 8 (and Laws 3 and 7) to simplify $(2x/y^2)^3$ in the following way: $$\\left(\\frac{2x}{y^2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{(2x)^3}{(y^2)^3} = \\frac{8x^3}{y^6}.$$\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Law 9: fractional power, the nth root\n\nWhen multiplying by bases with fractional powers (some sort of nth root) :\n\n$$a^{1/n} \\cdot b=\\sqrt[n]{a \\cdot b^n}$$\n\nWhere the aim of the manipulation is to put everything inside the $n$th root sign, then to continue with the calculation.\n\n:::\n\nThe main purpose of this law is to combine bases if you can; as evidenced in the next example. \n\n:::{.callout-note appearance='simple'}\n## Example 10\n\nSimplify $2^{1/3}\\cdot 4$. Here, you can use Law 9 to write $$2^{1/3}\\cdot 4 = \\sqrt[3]{2\\cdot 4^3}.$$ You know that $4 = 2^2$, and so using Law 3 and then Law 1 gives $$\\sqrt[3]{2\\cdot 4^3} = \\sqrt[3]{2\\cdot (2^2)^3} = \\sqrt[3]{2\\cdot 2^6} = \\sqrt[3]{2^7}$$ Finally, using Law 6 gives $$2^{1/3}\\cdot 4 = \\sqrt[3]{2^7} = 2^{7/3}.$$\n\n<!-- \\begin{align*} -->\n<!-- 2^{1/3}\\cdot 4 -->\n<!-- &= 2^{1/3}\\cdot 4^{3/3}\\nonumber \\\\[0.5em] -->\n<!-- &= \\sqrt[3]{2\\cdot 4^3}\\nonumber \\\\[0.5em] -->\n<!-- &= \\sqrt[3]{2\\cdot (2\\cdot 2)^3}\\nonumber \\\\[0.5em] -->\n<!-- &= \\sqrt[3]{2^7} \\tag{\\,$(2^2)^3=2^{2\\cdot 3}=2^6$}\\\\[0.5em]  -->\n<!-- &= 2^{7/3} -->\n<!-- \\end{align*} -->\n\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Law 10: multiplication under the root sign\n\nWhen you have a term under a $n$th root sign which you can factorise (split up into different factors) this can be done and the $n$th root signs can be dealt with separately.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sqrt[n]{a\\cdot b}=\\sqrt[n]{a}\\cdot\\sqrt[n]{b}\\end{align*}\n\nWhere you are using the commutativity of multiplication to split up the $n$th root and deal with terms separately.\n\nThis law is particularly useful for writing square roots more concisely.
