How exactly can you approach decision making in the face of uncertainty? For example, should you bring an umbrella tomorrow? Or, should you invest in a certain stock?\n\nWhen you are facing these situations, you could turn to **probability theory** to predict the likelihood of certain outcomes, especially when you have to make important decisions. Probability theory is not only foundational to the study of statistics, but also has uses in pure mathematics, quantum mechanics, economics, biology, and even in manufacturing.\n\nThis guide introduces you to probability theory. First, the concept of sample space will be explained. Next, the complement rule will be demonstrated, and a distinction will be made between theoretical probability and experimental probability. Then you will learn about independent and dependent events.\n\n# Sample space\n\nWhen thinking about probability of something happening, it is important to consider what all the possible **outcomes** are in that situation. The collection of all possible outcomes is known as the **sample space**.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Definition of sample space\n\nAn **outcome** is a single result of an experiment or situation. An **event** is some collection of outcomes.  The **sample space** is the set of *all possible* **outcomes**.\n\nMathematically speaking, an outcome is an element of the sample space, and an event is a subset of the sample space.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nMathematically speaking, an outcome is an element of the sample space, and an event is a subset of the sample space.\n:::\n\nThe sample space can be represented in various different ways, but one common example is to represent them as a **list** of outcomes.\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 1\n\nTry to flip a coin using the interactive app below.\n\nThere are two possible outcomes when you flip a coin: heads (H) or tails (T). Therefore, the sample space of flipping a coin once can be represented as $\\{H, T\\}$.\n\n:::\n\n```{shinylive-r}\n#| standalone: true\n#| viewerHeight: 340\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(bslib)\n\n# Hard-coded hex color for the button (a nice teal color)\nBUTTON_COLOR <- \"#3F6BB6\"\n\nui <- page_fluid(\n  title = \"Coin flipper\",\n  \n  card(\n    card_header(\"Coin flipper\"),\n    card_body(\n      # Use a row layout for landscape orientation\n      layout_columns(\n        col_widths = c(4, 4, 4), # Equal width columns\n        \n        # Left column: Description\n        card(\n          card_body(\n            div(\n              style = \"display: flex; height: 100%; align-items: center; justify-content: center;\",\n              p(\"Click the button to flip a coin.\", style = \"font-size: 18px;\")\n            )\n          )\n        ),\n        \n        # Middle column: Coin display\n        card(\n          card_body(\n            div(\n              style = \"text-align: center;\",\n              div(\n                style = \"font-size: 40px; line-height: 1.2; width: 150px; height: 150px; \n                       margin: 0 auto; border: 2px solid #ccc; border-radius: 50%;\n                       display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;\n                       background-color: #f0f0f0;\",\n                textOutput(\"coinResult\")\n              )\n            )\n          )\n        ),\n        \n        # Right column: Button\n        card(\n          card_body(\n            div(\n              style = \"display: flex; height: 100%; align-items: center; justify-content: center;\",\n              actionButton(\"flipButton\", \"Flip Coin\", class = \"btn-lg\", \n                          style = paste0(\"background-color: \", BUTTON_COLOR, \"; color: white;\"))\n            )\n          )\n        )\n      )\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nserver <- function(input, output, session) {\n  \n  # Create a reactive value to store the current coin side\n  coinResult <- reactiveVal(sample(c(\"HEADS\", \"TAILS\"), 1))\n  \n  # Update the coin result when the flip button is clicked\n  observeEvent(input$flipButton, {\n    # Flipping animation - this is a simplified version using invalidateLater\n    # to simulate the coin flipping\n    for(i in 1:5) {\n      invalidateLater(i * 100)\n    }\n    \n    # Final result\n    coinResult(sample(c(\"HEADS\", \"TAILS\"), 1))\n  })\n  \n  # Display the current coin result\n  output$coinResult <- renderText({\n    coinResult()\n  })\n}\n\n# Run the application \nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\n\n:::\n\n::: {.content-hidden when-format=\"html\"}\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 1\n\nLet's say you wanted to flip a single coin.

When the probability is $0$, there is no possibility of the event happening, and when the probability is $1$, the event will definitely happen. Therefore, probability cannot be less than $0$, and it cannot be more than $1$. \n\n  More formally, if $A$ is an event contained in a sample space $S$, then: $$0 \\leq \\mathbb{P}(A) \\leq 1.$$\n\n- The probabilities of all outcomes in an event always add up to $1$. \n\n  This can be expressed more formally as: $$\\sum_{x\\in S}P(x)=1$$\n\n:::\n\nFor example, when flipping a coin, the probability of getting heads is $\\frac{1}{2}$ (a number between $0$ and $1$), and the probability of getting tails is $\\frac{1}{2}$. You can add these up together to get: $$\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}=1$$\n\nNotice that, in this case, the probability of 'heads' is equal to the probability of 'tails' **not** occurring, and the probability of 'tails' is equal to the probability of 'heads' **not** occurring. Therefore, 'heads' and 'tails' can be called **complementary events**. You could then, for example, subtract the probability of 'heads' from 1 to get the probability of 'tails'. $$\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{tails})=1-\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{tails'})=1-\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{heads})=1-\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{2}$$ This is known as the **complement rule**.\n\n<!-- It also applies when probability is represented as a decimal or percentage: -->\n\n<!-- $$ -->\n<!-- \\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{tails})=1-\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{tails'})=1-\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{heads})=1-0.5=0.5 -->\n<!-- $$ -->\n\n<!-- and -->\n<!-- $$ -->\n<!-- \\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{tails})=1-\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{tails'})=1-\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{heads})=100\\%-50\\%=50\\% -->\n<!-- $$ -->\n\n## Theoretical probability and experimental probability {-}\n\nThere are two main types of probability: **theoretical probability** and **experimental probability**.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Definition of theoretical probability\n\n**Theoretical probability** is probability based on what you *expect* to happen.\n:::\n\nHere is how you can find theoretical probability:\n\n$$\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{event})=\\frac{\\textsf{number of desired outcomes}}{\\textsf{total number of possible outcomes}}$$\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 4\n\nRemember from Example 2 that there are six possible outcomes when you roll a standard fair six-sided die; $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. It's important to say here that each of the outcomes are equally likely - you have no more probability to roll a six than you do any other number.\n\nSo, what is the probability of the event where you roll a $6$? Here, there is one desired outcome - a $6$. The total number of possible outcomes is $6$. Therefore, the probability of rolling a $6$ is: $$\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{roll a 6}) = \\frac{1}{6}.$$\n\nSo, what is the probability of the event where you roll an odd number? Here, there is three desired outcomes - $1$, $3$ and $5$. The total number of possible outcomes is still $6$. Therefore, the probability of rolling an odd number is: $$\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{roll an odd number}) = \\frac{3}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}.$$\n\nFinally, what is the probability of not rolling a $6$? You could work this out using the complement rule. The probability of not rolling a $6$ is the same as $1$ minus the probability of rolling a $6$. Therefore, the probability of not rolling a $6$ is: $$\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{(roll a 6)}') = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{roll a 6}) = 1- \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{5}{6}.$$ This is the power of the complement rule!\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Definition of experimental probability\n\n**Experimental probability** is probability based on what actually happens.\n:::\n\nHere is how you can find experimental probability:\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{event})=\\frac{\\textsf{number of times that a desired event occurs}}{\\textsf{total number of trials in an experiment}}\n$$\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 5\n\nSuppose you flip a coin 1000 times. The probability of 'tails' may initially be higher or lower than 0.5. However, the more flips you do, the more the probability of 'tails' will tend to 0.5. This is an example of the **law of large numbers**: the more trials you do, the closer your experimental probability will get to the theoretical probability. \n\nYou can try this for yourself in the following interactive app:\n\n:::\n\n```{shinylive-r}\n#| standalone: true\n#| viewerHeight: 360\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(bslib)\n\n# Hard-coded hex color for the button (blue color requested)\nBUTTON_COLOR <- \"#3F6BB6\"\n\nui <- page_fluid(\n  title = \"Coin Flipper\",\n  \n  card(\n    card_header(\"Coin Flipper\"),\n    card_body(\n      # Use a row layout for landscape orientation\n      layout_columns(\n        col_widths = c(4, 4, 4), # Equal width columns\n        \n        # Left column: Description and stats\n        card(\n          card_body(\n            div(\n              style = \"display: flex;

The probability of 'tails' may initially be higher or lower than 0.5. However, the more flips you do, the more the probability of 'tails' will tend to 0.5. This is an example of the **law of large numbers**: the more trials you do, the closer your experimental probability will get to the theoretical probability.\n\nYou can see this visually demonstrated in the graph below:\n\n![Experimental probability of tails over the course of 1000 coin flips.](./FiguresPNG/cumulativecoinflip.png)\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n<!-- For reference, here is the R code to generate this figure: -->\n\n<!-- coin \\<- c(0, 1) -->\n\n<!-- maxn \\<- 1000 -->\n\n<!-- flips \\<- sample(x=coin, size=maxn, replace=TRUE) -->\n\n<!-- cum.flips \\<- cumsum(flips) -->\n\n<!-- ntrials \\<- 1:maxn -->\n\n<!-- prop.flips \\<- cum.flips/ntrials -->\n\n<!-- plot(x=ntrials, y=prop.flips, type=\"b\", xlab=\"Number of flips\", ylab=\"Probability of tails\") -->\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n# Outcomes that vary in probability\n\nThe examples you have examined so far involve events with equally probable outcomes. For instance, you have a 50/50 chance of getting either heads or tails after flipping a coin. Similarly, it is equally likely for you to get any number between 1 and 6 after rolling a fair die: a $\\frac{1}{6}$ chance. But what if the outcomes vary in probability?\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\nWhen all outcomes are equally likely, the sample space is **uniform**. When the outcomes vary in probability, the sample space is **not uniform**.\n\nHowever, this property is not necessarily reflected in the sample space. For example, even if you flip a biased coin that is more likely to get 'heads', the sample space is still represented as $\\{H, T\\}$.\n\nThe next step in analyzing non-uniform sample spaces is the use of **probability mass functions** or **probability density functions**. See [Guide: PMFs, PDFs, CDFs](pmfspdfscdfs.qmd) for more.\n\n:::\n\nIt then becomes all the more useful to represent these outcomes with tree diagrams, since outcomes can have different probabilities.\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 6\n\nSuppose that you have a bag containing 5 marbles in total, with 2 red marbles and 3 blue marbles.

Imagine a jar containing 10 candies. It has 1 yellow candy, 4 green candies, and 5 purple candies. If you take one candy from the jar, what is the probability of each colour being taken?\n\n![Tree diagram for candy jar in Example 7.](./FiguresPNG/introtoprobability-fig3-10.png)\n\nSince $\\frac{4}{10}=\\frac{2}{5}$ and $\\frac{5}{10}=\\frac{1}{2}$, the diagram can be simplified as follows:\n\n![Simplified tree diagram for candy jar in Example 7.](./FiguresPNG/introtoprobability-fig4-11.png)\n\nAs shown in the diagram, $\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{yellow})$ is $\\frac{1}{10}$, $\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{green})$ is $\\frac{2}{5}$, and $\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{purple})$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe **complement rule** also applies to non-uniform sample spaces. Consider the candy jar example. What if you knew the probability of taking a yellow or purple candy, but not the probability of taking a green candy?\n\n![Incomplete tree diagram for candy jar in Example 7.](./FiguresPNG/introtoprobability-fig5-12.png)\n\nTo apply the complement rule, you should first find the probability of **not** taking the green candy. You can do this by adding together the probabilities of taking a yellow or purple candy. $$\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{(green)}')=\\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{yellow}) + \\mathbb{P}(\\textsf{purple}) =  \\frac{1}{10}+\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{10}+\\frac{5}{10}=\\frac{6}{10}$$\n\nThe probability of taking the green candy is **complementary** to the probability of not taking the green candy.
