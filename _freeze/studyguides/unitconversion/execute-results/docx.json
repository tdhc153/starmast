Sometimes different people will use different units when talking about the same thing, so converting between units is very important. Understanding strategies of converting between unit systems, area, volume, and time is an important skill in science.\ncategories:\n  - Solving equations\n  - Key skills\nimage: FiguresPNG/completingthesquare-image.png\ndraft: true\n---\n\n\n\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n```{=html}\n<table><tr><td style=\"vertical-align: middle\"><strong>Narration of study guide:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td><audio controls><source src=\"./Narrations/completingthesquare.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio></tr></table>\n```\n\n:::\n\n# Motivation for the Importance of Units and Converting Units\n\nImagine your friend is going to the market, and you want them to buy 5 apples. Instead, you say, “buy me five fruits.” Later that day, your friend returns with 5 oranges, which is not what you wanted. The reason you didn’t get apples is that you didn’t specify the type of fruit you wanted. In other words, you must specify the **unit** of the item you’re referring to. In this case, the unit of the item you wanted is an apple.\n\nNow imagine you’re baking a cake from a recipe that calls for 8 ounces of butter. Unfortunately the butter you have is measured in grams, so you do not know how much butter you need to put into your cake. To solve this problem, you must know how many grams are in 8 ounces.This is the process of **converting** one unit to another. \n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Definition of a unit\n\nA unit expresses any quantity which you are trying to measure.\n:::\n\nUnits allow you to communicate measurements clearly. Let's say that a distance is 5 metres long is more precise than saying it is \"far away\". If two quantities are measured in the same units, they are more intuitive to compare. Some examples of units which you have probably seen are metres to measure length, seconds to measure time, and kilograms to measure mass.\n\n## Unit Systems\n\nDepending on where you are in the world, you may use different units as someone else to measure the same thing. A very good example of this is height. Suppose that there is a man called Bob from France who is 183 cm tall. If Bob traveled to the United States and told someone his height, they may be confused as they do not usually measure height in centimetres. However if Bob says that he is 6 feet tall they will probably understand, as in the United States height is normally measured in feet and inches.\n\nToday, the two most common unit systems you have are the **metric system** and the **imperial system**. \n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Metric System\n\nIncludes units such as metres for length, kilograms for mass, and litres for volume.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Imperial System\n\nIncludes units such as feet for length, pounds for weight, and gallons for volume.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\nNo matter what units you decide to use, make sure you keep them the same for the problem you are working on. In 1998, the science and technology organisation, NASA, launched the Mars Climate Orbiter to study the planet Mars. After it was launched, the orbiter approached Mars too close and was destroyed by the atmosphere. A later investigation  found that the error was due to two groups of people using two different unit systems. Making a mistake with units can be disastrous!\n\n:::\n\n# Converting Between Unit Systems\n\nTo convert between unit systems, you need to know the relationship between the two units.\n\nA strategy you can use when converting units is;\n\n- Step 1: Identify the quantity you want to find\n- Step 2: Determine how much of one unit is equal to another\n- Step 3: Multiply or divide to scale the quantity to the value you want\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 1\n\nLet us look at the cake example from earlier. The recipe of the cake requires 8 ounces of butter, but you want to know how much that is in grams.\n\nFirst, you must identify that you need to convert $8$ ounces to some amount of grams.\n\nSecond, you need to know the the relationship between ounces and grams. An approximation is given here;\n\n$$1 \\textsf{ ounces} \\approx 28.35 \\textsf{ grams}$$\n\nLastly, you need to find out how many grams are in 8 ounces. You  know the amount of grams in 1 ounce, so you can multiply that amount by 8 to get the number of grams in 8 ounces.\n\n$$8 \\textsf{ ounces} \\approx  8 \\cdot 28.35 \\textsf{ grams}$$\n\n$$8 \\textrm{ oz} = 8 \\cdot 28.35 \\textrm{ g}$$\n\n$8$ $ounces$ $=$ $226.20$ $grams$\n\nSo you need $226.20$ grams of butter in our cake\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 2\n\nA builder is assembling a cabinet which needs to be $40$ centimetres in width. However, they only have a tape measure which has inches on it. What does the width of the cabinet need to be in inches?\n\nFirst, you want to convert $40 \\textrm{ cm}$ to some amount of $\\textrm{in}$.\n\nSecond, you will establish the relationship between inches and centimetres. An approximation is given below.\n\n$2.5 \\textrm{ cm}$ $\\approx$ $1 \\textrm{ in}$.\n\nLastly, you need to find how many inches are in $40 \\textrm{ cm}$. To get from $2.5 \\textrm{ cm}$ to $40 \\textrm{ cm}$, you can multiply by $16$.\n\n$2.5 \\cdot 16 \\textrm{ cm} \\approx 1 \\cdot 16 \\textrm{ in}$\n\n$40 \\textrm{ cm} \\approx 16 16 \\textrm{ in}$\n\n:::\n\n# Unit Prefixes\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Unit Prefixes\n\nUnit prefixes are used to scale a unit to larger or smaller values. They are represented by a letter in front of the unit.\n\n:::\n\nThe metric system uses unit prefixes to scale a unit to larger or smaller values. It makes very large and very small units more natural to read. For example, I can say that my weight is $60,000$ grams. This is a large number and is not intuitive to understand its size. More commonly weight is measured in kilograms, so my weight can be written as $60$ kilograms. This number is more useful if you want to write my weight down on a medical form as you don't need to write many of the $0$ digits.\n\nOther units which are not in the metric system may use unit prefixes. Examples include parsecs (which measures distances in space) or acres (which measure area of land).\n\nBelow are some common prefixes of base ten.\n\n| Prefix | Symbol | Multiplier | Meaning |\n|--------|--------|------------|---------|\n| giga- | G | $10^9$ | one billion |\n| mega- | M | $10^6$ | one million |\n| kilo- | k | $10^3$ | one thousand |\n| hecto- | h | $10^2$ | one hundred |\n| deca- | da | $10^1$ | ten |\n| (base unit) | - | $10^0$ | one |\n| deci- | d | $10^{-1}$ | one tenth |\n| centi- | c | $10^{-2}$ | one hundredth |\n| milli- | m | $10^{-3}$ | one thousandth |\n| micro- | $\\mu$ | $10^{-6}$ | one millionth |\n| nano- | n | $10^{-9}$ | one billionth |\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Tip: Unit prefix conversion\n\nConverting to a **smaller unit** you should **multiply** by an appropriate power of $10$.\n\nConverting to a **larger unit** you should **divide** by an appropriate power of $10$.\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 3\n\nA scientist is carrying out a study in the Amazon rainforest about a rare type of lizard. They measure the length of several lizards and find their average length to be $1.35 \\textrm{ cm}$. What is the average length of the lizards in both metres and millimetres?\n\nYou are going to use the same strategy as you did when converting between unit systems.\n\nTo find the length in metres, you are going to establish a relationship between centimetres and metres. Our base unit is going to be metres, because is does not have a prefix in front of it. From our table, the **centi-** prefix represents the $10^{-2}$ multiplier. This is the same thing as saying $1$ centimetre is equal to $1$ metre divided by $100$. Writing this as an equation gives;\n\n$1 \\textrm{ cm} = 1 \\cdot 10^{-2} \\textrm{ m} = \\frac{1}{100} \\textrm{ m}$\n\nYou want to know how many metres are in $1.35 \\textrm{ cm}$. So you can multiply the relationship you found by $1.35$.\n\n$1.35 \\textrm{ cm} = 1.35 \\cdot \\frac{1}{100} \\textrm{ m}$\n\n$1.35 \\textrm{ cm} = 0.0135 \\textrm{ m}$\n\nNow, you will do the same for millimetres. You know that the multipliers centi and milli are $10^{-2}$ and $10^{-3}$ respectively. This means that the centi- prefix is ten times larger than the milli- prefix. So you can make an equation linking them both together.\n\n$1 \\textrm{ cm} = 10 \\textrm{ mm}$\n\nNow multiply the equation by $1.35$.\n\n$1.35 \\textrm{ cm} = 13.5 \\textrm{ mm}$\n\nSo the length of the lizard can be written as $0.0135 \\textrm{ m}$ or $13.5 \\textrm{ mm}$.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 4\n\nA meteorologist is working in a coastal town. They find the air pressure to be $1013 \\textrm{ hPa}$, where $\\textrm{Pa}$ is a unit for pressure called Pascals. Convert this air pressure to $\\textrm{MPa}$.\n\nYou know that the multipliers hecto- and Mega- are $10^{2}$ and $10^{6}$ respectively. This means that the mega- prefix is ten thousand times larger than the hecto- prefix.\n\n$10,000 \\textrm{ hPa} = 1 \\textrm{ MPa}$\n\nDivide both sides by $10,000$.\n\n$1 \\textrm{ hPa}$ = $\\frac{1}{10,000}$ $MPa$\n\nMultiply both sides by $1013$.\n\n$1013 \\textrm{ hPa}$ = $\\frac{1013}{10,000} \\textrm{ MPa}$\n\n$1013 \\textrm{ hPa}$ = $0.1013 \\textrm{ MPa}$\n\nSo the air pressure is $0.1013 \\textrm{ MPa}$.\n\n:::\n\n# Converting Units of Area and Volume\n\nyou have seen examples of converting one unit of length to another. To do this you multiplied or divided by some scale factor. When converting area and volume to different units, you need to be careful because the scale factors are squared (for area) or cubed (for volume).\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Definition of area\n\n**Area** is the measure of the amount of space taken up by a two-dimensional surface.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Definition of volume\n\n**Volume** is the measure of the amount of space taken up by a three-dimensional object.\n:::\n\nIf you have a square whose sides are length $1 \\textrm{ m}$, then its area will be $1 \\textrm{ m}^2$. To convert its area into $\\textrm{cm}^2$, you first must convert the length of the sides to centimetres. The length of the sides are then equivalent to $100$ $cm$, which means the area is $10,000 \\textrm{ cm}^2$. Our scale factor when converting the length is $10^2$. When looking at the area, $1 \\textrm{ m}^2$ is equal to $10,000 \\textrm{ cm}^2$. This means our scale factor for area is $10^4$, which can be written as $(10^2)^2$. you find that the area scale factor is the square of our length scale factor.\n\nDoing a similar exercise with a cube, you can find that the volume scale is the cube of the length scale factor.\n\n![The same square mesured whose sides are measuerd in metres (left) and centimetres (right) ](./FiguresPNG/unitconversion-fig1.png){width=\"100%\" fig-alt=\"Square measurements\" #fig-squaremeasurements}\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 5\n\nYou are a farmer who owns $800,000 \\textrm{ m}^2$ of land. Convert this area to $\\textrm{km}^2$.\n\nIf you were converting length from metres to kilometres you would divide by $10^3$. However because you want the area, so you must square the scale factor you use. So our area scale factor is $(10^3)^2$.\n\n$1$ $m^2$ $=$ $\\frac{1}{(10^3)^2} \\textrm{ km}^2$ $=$ $10^{-6}$ $km^2$ $=$ $\\frac{1}{1,000,000} \\textrm{ km}^2$\n\n$1$ $m ^2$ $=$ $\\frac{1}{1,000,000} \\textrm{ km}^2$\n\nNow multiply the equation by $800,000$.\n\n$800,000 \\textrm{ m}^2$ $=$ $\\frac{800,000}{1,000,000} \\textrm{ km}^2$\n\n$800,000 \\textrm{ m}^2$ $=$ $0.8 \\textrm{ km}^2$\n\nSo the area of land can be written as $0.8 \\textrm{ km}^2$\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 6\n\nThe volume of water in a pool is $75$ $m^3$. Find how much water there is in litres.\n\nFirstly, it is worth noting that $1 \\textrm{ l} = 1 \\textrm{ dm}^3$. So converting the area to cubic decimetres is the same as converting it to litres.\n\nIf you were converting length from metres to decimetres you would multiply by $10^1$. However because you want the volume, so you must cube the scale factor you use. So our volume scale factor is $(10^1)^3$.\n\n$1 \\textrm{ m}^3 = (10^1)^3 \\textrm{ dm}^3 = 10^{3} \\textrm{ dm}^3 = 1000 \\textrm{ dm}^3$\n\n$1 \\textrm{ m}^3 = 1000 \\textrm{ dm}^3$\n\nNow multiply the equation by $75$.\n\n$75 \\cdot 1 \\textrm{ mm}^3 = 75 \\cdot 1000 \\textrm{ dm}^3$\n\n$75 \\textrm{ m}^3 = 75 ,000 \\textrm{ dm}^3$\n\nSo the volume of water can be written as $75,000 \\textrm{ l}$.\n:::\n\n# Conversions for Time\n\nUnlike the metric system, units of time do not completely use base ten prefixes. Some  time conversions are seen below.\n\n\n| Unit | Symbol | Conversion |\n|------|--------|------------|\n| seconds | s | - |\n| minutes | min | 60 seconds|\n| hours | h | 60 minutes |\n| days | d | 24 hours |\n| week | wk | 7 days |\n| (typical) year | yr | 365 days |\n\n\nSometimes you can use unit prefixes when describing time. This is usually done with time periods much smaller than one second. \n\n| Unit | Symbol | Conversion (s) |\n|------|--------|----------------|\n| milliseconds | ms | 0.001 |\n| nanosecond | ns | 0.000000001 |\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 7\n\nHow many many hours are in 3.5 days?\n\nWriting the relationship between days and hours;\n\n$1 \\textrm{ d} = 24 \\textrm{ h}$\n\nNow multiply the equation by $3.5$.\n\n$1 \\cdot \\textrm{ d}$ $=$ $3.5 \\cdot 24 \\textrm{ h}$\n\n$3.5 \\textrm{ d} = 84 \\textrm{ h}$\n\nHence there are $84$ hours in $3.5$ days.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 8\n\nThe Silk Road was a network of ancient trade routes which spanned most of Asia. It can take a person 2 years to travel from China to Rome using the road. Calculate how long the journey will be in seconds.\n\n<!-- If you remember that $1$ $yr$ $=$ $31,536,000$ $s$, then you can multiply the equation by $2$. -->\n\n<!-- $2$ $yr$ $=$ $63,072,000$ $s$ -->\n\nWe are not given a direct relationship between years and seconds. Instead, you can break down this question into multiple conversions.\n\nFirst, youwill start by converting 2 years into days.\n\n$2 \\textrm{ yr} = 2 \\cdot 365 \\textrm {d} = 730 \\textrm { d}$\n\nThen you will convert this to hours.\n\n$730 \\textrm{ d} = 24 \\cdot 730 \\textrm{ h} = 17520 \\textrm{ h}$\n\nThen to minutes.\n\n$17520 \\textrm{ h} = 60 \\cdot 17520 \\textrm{ min} = 1,051,200 \\textrm{ min}$\n\nAnd finally to seconds.\n\n$1,051,200 \\textrm{ min} = 60 \\cdot 1,051,200 \\textrm{ s} = 63,072,000 \\textrm{ s}$\n\n\nTherefore it will take $63,072,000$ seconds to walk from China to Rome.\n\nBy methodically converting years to smaller units of time, you can find time into seconds without memorising the number of seconds in a year!\n\n:::\n\n# Compound Units\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Definition of a compound unit.\n\nCompound units are measures which combine two or more other units. Examples include $\\textrm{m/s}$ for speed,  $\\textrm{kg/m}^3$ for density, or $\\textrm{N/m}^2$ for pressure.\n\n:::\n\nWhen converting compound units, you may need to carry out more than one conversion. you will follow the same strategy you have been using so far.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 9\n\nThe top speed of a race car is $360$ $\\textrm{ km/h}$. Convert this speed to $\\textrm{m/s}$.\n\nThe speed of the car is made up of two components. The distance in $km$ is on the numerator of the fraction. The time in $s$ is on the denominator. you must convert both of these quantities to find a scale factor, and write them into a fraction.\n\n$1 \\cdot\\frac{\\textrm{km}}{\\textrm{h}} = \\frac{1000}{60 \\cdot 60} \\cdot\\frac{\\textrm{m}}{\\textrm{s}} = \\frac{1000}{3600} \\cdot \\frac{\\textrm{m}}{\\textrm{s}}$\n\n$1 \\cdot \\frac{\\textrm{km}}{\\textrm{h}} = \\frac{1000}{3600} \\cdot \\frac{\\textrm{m}}{\\textrm{s}}$\n\n\n\nNow that you have a scale factor, you can multiply the equation by $360$.\n\n$360 \\cdot \\frac{\\textrm{km}}{\\textrm{h}} = 360 \\cdot \\frac{1000}{3600} \\cdot \\frac{\\textrm{m}}{\\textrm{s}}$\n\n$360 \\textrm{ km/h} = 100 \\textrm{ m/s}$\n\n\nTherefore, the speed of the race car is $100 \\textrm{ m/s}$.\n\n:::\n\n# Quick check problems {-}\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n::: {.webex-check .webex-box data-topic=\"AOCN1\"}\n\n1.
