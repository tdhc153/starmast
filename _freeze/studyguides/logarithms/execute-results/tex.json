Logarithms are useful because they essentially let you work backwards through a calculation by undoing exponential effects. Furthermore, logarithms allow you to express large numbers in a convenient way, as well as model various phenomena as they occur in a logarithmic fashion. An example would be a hot object cooling down; this cools down logarithmically.\n\nIn this guide, you will learn the definition of a logarithm, the laws concerning logarithms, what the natural logarithm is and finally, how to change the base of a logarithm.\n\n::: {#definition-1-link .callout-note}\n\n## Definition of a logarithm\n\nIn its simplest form, a logarithm answers 'How many of one number multiply together to make another number?'. This is what motivates the following definition:\n\nIf $$a^x = b$$ then\n\n$$\\log_a(b) = x$$ where $a,b > 0$ and $a\\neq 1$. Here, $x$ is known as the *exponent*, $a$ is the *base* and $b$ is the *argument*. You would read the equation above as \"logarithm of $b$ to the base $a$ is equal to $x$\".\n:::\n\n::: {callout-important}\nNote that the logarithm function can only evaluate **real, positive numbers**. Therefore, **you cannot compute the logarithm of a number that is less than or equal to $0$**.\n:::\n\n::: {#example-1-link .callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 1\n\nSuppose you are given the equation $\\log_{10}(1000) = x$, and you need to find $x$. You can rewrite the equation as $10^x = 1000$, and from here, you can see that $x = 3$.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 2\n\nNow consider the equation $\\log_x(8) = 3$. Rewriting this, you can see that this is equal to $x^3 = 8$. Therefore $x = 2$.\n:::\n\nGenerally, if the base is not specified, it is assumed that the base is $10$. For example, $\\log(a) = b$ means that the logarithm of $a$ to the base $10$ is equal to $b$.  \n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 3\n\nConsider the equation from [Example 1](#example-1-link). This can be rewritten as $\\log(1000) = x$, and the solution for $x$ is once again $x = 3$.\n:::\n\nThat being said, it is good practice to always specify the base of the logarithm that you are using.\n\nFollowing from the [definition](#definition-1-link) of a logarithm, you can make two key observations.\n\n::: {#law-6-link .callout-note}\n## Inverse of a logarithm\n\n$$\\log_b(b^k) = k$$ The logarithm of an exponential where the base is equal to the base of the logarithm is equal to the exponent.\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\n## Inverse of an exponent\n\n$$b^{\\log_b(k)} = k$$ Raising a logarithm of a number to its own base is equal to the number itself.\n:::\n\nThe results above are equivalent to the definition of the logarithm, and are often used. You should remember these results!\n\n# Laws of logarithms {-}\n\nFollowing on from the laws of indices, there are several rules of logarithms that allows you to expand, condense and solve logarithmic equations. For this section, assume that $a$ is a positive real number with $a \\neq 1$.\n\n::: {#product-rule-link .callout-note}\n## Law 1: product rule\n\n$$\\log_a(M \\cdot N) = \\log_a(M) + \\log_a(N)$$ The logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms of the factors.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 4\n\n1. $\\log_a(100) = \\log_a(10 \\cdot 10) = \\log_a(10) + \\log_a(10)$\n\n2. $\\log_a(27) = \\log_a(3 \\cdot 9) = \\log_a(3) + \\log_a(9) = \\log_a(3) + \\log_a(3) + \\log_a(3)$\n\n3. $\\log_2(x^4y^4) = \\log_2(x^4) + \\log_2(y^4)$.\n\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\n## Law 2: quotient rule\n\n$$\\log_a\\left(\\frac{M}{N}\\right) = \\log_a(M) - \\log_a(N) $$ The logarithm of a ratio of two numbers is equal to the logarithm of the **numerator** minus the logarithm of the **denominator**.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 5\n\n1. $\\log_a\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right) = \\log_a(5) - \\log_a(4)$\n\n2. $\\log_a(27) = \\log_a\\left(\\frac{54}{2}\\right) = \\log_a(54) - \\log_a(2)$\n\n3. $\\log_2(x^4y^{-4}) = \\log_2\\left(\\dfrac{x^4}{y^{4}}\\right) = \\log_2(x^4) - \\log_2(y^4)$.\n\n:::\n\n::: {#law-3-link .callout-note}\n## Law 3: power rule\n\n$$\\log_a(M^k) = k \\cdot \\log_a(M)$$ The logarithm of an exponential number is the exponent multiplied with the logarithm of the base.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 6\n\n1. $\\log_a(4) = \\log_a(2^2) = 2 \\cdot \\log_a(2)$\n\n2. $\\log_a(27) = \\log_a(3^3) = 3 \\cdot \\log_a(3)$\n\n3. Using the laws of indices, $\\log_2(x^4y^4) = \\log_2\\left((xy)^4\\right) = 4\\log_2(xy)$.\n\n(You can compare 2. to Example 4 (2) above!)\n\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\n## Law 4: zero rule\n\n$$\\log_a(1) = 0$$ The logarithm of 1 to any base is **always** equal to 0.\n\nThis is true as $$a^0 = 1$$ using the [definition](#definition-1-link) of the logarithm.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 7\n\n1. $\\log_4(1) = 0$\n\n2. $\\log_{10}(1) = 0$\n\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\n## Law 5: identity rule\n\n$$\\log_a(a) = 1$$\n\nThe logarithm of the argument, where the argument is equal to the base of the logarithm, is **always** equal to 1.\n\nThis is true as $$a^1 = a$$ for all positive real numbers $a$ and by also using the [definition](#definition-1-link) of the logarithm.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 8\n\nFor instance, $\\log_4(4) = 1$ and $\\log_{10}(10) = 1$.\n\n:::\n\n# The natural logarithm\n\nTo learn about the natural logarithm, you first need to know of **Euler's number**.\n\n::: callout-note\n\n## Euler's number\n\n**Euler's number**, denoted *e*, is an irrational mathematical constant that is approximately equal to 2.718281828...\n\n:::\n\nMuch like $\\pi$, the decimal representation of $e$ never repeats itself; it is an **irrational number**. Euler's number $e$ appears naturally in various phenomena involving exponential growth and decay; as well as in important mathematical settings such as calculus and dealing with complex numbers. It is one of the most important mathematical constants yet discovered.\n\nNow, the natural logarithm is a mathematical function used to study problems specifically involving exponential growth and decay. Unlike the logarithms you encountered above, this logarithm always has $e$ as its base.\n\n::: {#definition-2-link .callout-note}\n## The natural logarithm\n\nThe **natural logarithm**, often denoted $\\ln(x)$, is $\\log_e(x)$.\n:::\n\nThe natural logarithm shares the same domain as the logarithms above, namely that it only evaluates **positive, real** numbers. All of the laws from above apply to the natural logarithm as well.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 9\n\nSuppose you are given the equation $\\ln(x) = 4$ and asked to find $x$.\n\nUsing the definition of a [natural logarithm](#definition-2-link), you can show that $\\log_e(x) = 4$. Then, using the definition of a [logarithm](#definition-1-link), you can conclude that $x = e^4$. \n\n:::\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\nThe natural logarithm is useful as it is the **inverse** of the exponential function $e^x$. A graph of the natural logarithm, as well as its corresponding exponential curve, is shown in the interactive figure below.\n\n<!-- ![A pair of parabolas.

Taking the natural logarithm on both sides of the equation gives you\n$$\\ln(e^x) = \\ln(5)$$ Now, using [Law 3](#law-3-link), you can write the equation as  $$x\\ln(e) = \\ln(5)$$\nFrom here, dividing both sides by $\\ln(e)$ results in $$x = \\frac{\\ln(5)}{\\ln(e)}$$\n\nHowever, you know from the [definition](#definition-1-link) of the logarithm that $\\ln(e) = \\log_e(e)$. Finally, $\\log_e(e) = 1$ by the [inverse of a logarithm](#law-6-link) rule.\n\nTherefore, $x = \\ln(5)$.\n\n:::\n\n# Changing bases of logarithms {-}\n\nChanging the base of a logarithm can be done for a variety of reasons. A few common reasons might be:\n\n- **Familiarity**: Sometimes, changing the base of a logarithm can make calculations more familiar. For example, working with base $10$ logarithms is common in many areas of engineering, physics and chemistry, as they allow for simpler calculations by working with powers of $10$.\n\n- **Solving equations**: Changing the base of a logarithm can sometimes help make a calculation simpler. You could change the base in order to work in a base that suits the problem at hand better. An example would be wanting to work with the [natural logarithm](#definition-2-link) when working on problems involving [Euler's number](#euler-number).\n\n- **Using calculators**: Some calculators may only allow logarithms of base $10$ or the natural logarithm to be computed. For this reason, it is important to know how to write out logarithms of any base into one that is required for use.\n\n::: {#change-base-rule .callout-note}\n\n## Change of base rule\n\nChanging the base of any logarithm can be done by using the following formula\n\n$$\\log_a(x) = \\frac{\\log_b(x)}{\\log_b(a)}$$\nwhere \n\n- $x$ is the argument (which cannot be negative)\n- $a$ is the original base, where $a > 0$.\n- $b$ is the new base, where $b > 0$ and $b\\neq 1$.\n\nYou can note that by multiplying by $\\log_b(a)$, you can recover an alternative formula for the change of base rule with $\\log_b(x)$ as the argument: $$\\log_b(x) = \\log_b(a)\\cdot \\log_a(x)$$ Using either form of the change of base rule is allowed!\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 11\n\nYou are asked to work out $\\log_2(e^5)$.\n\nUsing the [change of base rule](#change-base-rule), and the fact that you can write $\\ln$ to mean $\\log_e$, you can write that:\n\n$$\\log_2(e^5) = \\frac{\\ln(e^5)}{\\ln(2)}$$\nUsing the [inverse of a logarithm](#law-6-link) rule, you can work out that $\\ln(e^5) = 5$. Therefore, the equation above simplifies to $$\\log_2(e^5) = \\frac{5}{\\ln(2)}.$$ Putting this into a calculator gives $$\\log_2(e^5) = \\frac{5}{\\ln(2)} = 7.21348 \\quad\\textsf{to 5 decimal places.}$$\n\n:::\n\n\n# Quick check problems {-}\n\n<!-- add facility for webexercises to work on html -->\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n<!-- add facility to check answers at end rather than one at a time -->\n\n::: {.webex-check .webex-box data-topic=\"ITL1\"}\n\n1.
