In addition, [Guide: Logarithms](logarithms.qmd) is recommended but not required for some of the material in this guide.*\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<table><tr><td style=\"vertical-align: middle\"><strong>Narration of study guide:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td><audio controls><source src=\"./Narrations/solvingeqsindices.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio></tr></table>\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\nIn [Guide: Laws of indices](lawsofindices.qmd), you learned about the different ways that you can manipulate expressions involving powers (like $x^3$ and $2^{80}$) and $n$th roots (such as $\\sqrt[4]{x}$ and $2^{1/80}$). In general mathematical life however, this knowledge will not be enough; you will need to apply these laws of indices to help you solve equations. \n\nSolving equations involving indices is a key skill in areas whenever exponential growth or decay plays a role: economics, physics (particularly nuclear physics), chemistry, biology, and many more.\n\nBefore you get started however, it is worth reiterating the recommendation above:\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n\n**This guide assumes an excellent knowledge of the laws of indices. Please make sure that you have read [Guide: Laws of indices](lawsofindices.qmd) before continuing.** \n\nThe numbering of the laws will follow the numbering in this guide and on [Factsheet: Laws of indices](../factsheets/f-lawsofindices.qmd).\n\nIn addition, an initial understanding of logarithms will be required later in the guide. While this understanding is partially explained in this guide, you may want to familiarize yourself with [Guide: Logarithms](logarithms.qmd) before attempting Examples 7, 8, 9, and 10.\n\n:::\n\n# Discussion of techniques\n\nIn general, the golden rule of solving equations involving indices is the following:\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\n**Make sure both sides are the in the same base before simplifying**. This is because if $a$ is a positive number not equal to $1$ and $a^m = a^n$, then you can immediately say that $m = n$ and solve the equation from there.\n\n:::\n\nHowever, you may be wondering; why on earth is this true? How can you ignore the base in this case? Or, more pertinently, *what if you can't write the equation in a form where both sides have the same base*?\n\nWhat you can do in this case is isolate the variable on one side of the equation, and have a constant on the other (see [Guide: Introduction to rearranging equations](introtorearrange.qmd) for more); perhaps it looks like $a^x = b$. From there, you can take **logarithms** to base $a$ of both sides.\n\nSince for all $a > 0$ with $a \\neq 1$ and all real numbers $y$: \n\n$$\\quad a^{\\log_a(y)} = y\\qquad \\textsf{ and }\\qquad \\log_a (a^y) = y$$\nit follows that $$\\log_a(a^x) = \\log_a b$$ implies that $$x = \\log_a b$$ solving the equation! What this means is that logarithms undo exponentiation and exponentiation undoes logarithms. \n\nIn particular, this is why $a^m = a^n$ implies that $m = n$. Taking logarithms to base $a$ of both sides of $a^m = a^n$ gives $\\log_a a^m = \\log_a a^n$; using the above result then yields $m = n$. \n\nHowever, please be aware of the following:\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n\n**You cannot take logarithms of a negative number!** So an expression like $\\log_a(-4)$ is **not** defined.\n\n:::\n\nThis is particularly pertinent in Example 9 below.\n\nIn this guide, logarithms are only used to undo exponentiation to solve equations; there will not be any applications of the laws of logarithms nor the change of base rule. (For more on these, see [Guide: Logarithms](logarithms.qmd).)\n\n# Examples\n\n## Initial examples {-}\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 1\n\nSolve $x^{\\frac{1}{2}}=8$.\n\nYou can start squaring both sides of the equation to get $(x^{\\frac{1}{2}})^2 = 8^2$. Using Law 3, $(x^{1/2})^2 = x^{2/2} = x$; so then you get the answer $x = 64$. To check if the answer is correct, you can substitute $64$ back into the equation: $64^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt[2]{64}=8$.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 2\n\nSolve $x^{-2}=9$.\n\nUsing Law 5, $x^{-2} = 9$ can be re-expressed as $\\frac{1}{x^2} = 9$. Multiplying both sides by $x^2$ gives you $1=9x^2$.\nThen dividing both sides by $9$ gives you $\\frac{1}{9}=x^2$. Remembering you can have positive and negative roots, you get $x= \\frac{1}{3}$ or $x= -\\frac{1}{3}$ as the two solutions to this equation.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 3\n\nSolve $3^{4x}=27^{5-x}$.\n\nYou can notice here that the two sides of the equation have different bases; so you need to write these in the same base. As $27=3^3$, the equation can be rewritten as: $3^{4x}=(3^3)^{5-x}$. Then using Law 3, you can write $3^{4x}=3^{15-3x}$. Since the bases of both sides are equal, you can say that $4x=15-3x$. Rearranging gives $x= 15/7$.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 4\n\nSolve $x^{\\frac{5}{3}} + 3x^{\\frac{2}{3}} = 10x^{-\\frac{1}{3}}$.\n\nIf you look at all of the indices in the question, the denominator is $3$ and that is a hint of what you need to multiply by. Multiply by $x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ on both sides of the equation; using Law 1, this gives\n\\begin{align*}\nx^{\\frac{5}{3}}\\cdot x^{\\frac{1}{3}} + 3x^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\cdot x^{\\frac{1}{3}} &= 10x^{-\\frac{1}{3}}\\cdot x^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\\\\nx^{\\frac{6}{3}} + 3x^{\\frac{3}{3}} &= 10x^0\n\\end{align*}\nUsing Law 4, you can further simplify this expression to get $x^2 +3x = 10$, and so $x^2+3x-10=0$. This is a quadratic equation; factorizing this equation gives you $(x+5)(x-2)=0$, then you can get $x=-5$ and $x=2$ as the two possible solutions to this equation.\n\n:::\n\n<!-- ::: {.callout-tip} -->\n\n<!-- When dealing with equations, you may find yourself faced with the following form: -->\n<!-- \\begin{align*} -->\n<!-- \\dfrac{1}{a+\\sqrt{b}}\\end{align*} -->\n\n<!-- In which case you will want to use the **conjugate** of the denominator to *creatively* multiply the fraction by 1. The conjugate of $a+\\sqrt{b}$ is $a-\\sqrt{b}$, to find this for any espression you change the sign in front of the root. -->\n\n<!-- \\begin{align*} -->\n<!-- \\dfrac{1}{a+\\sqrt{b}}\\cdot 1&= \\dfrac{1}{a+\\sqrt{b}}\\cdot\\dfrac{a-\\sqrt{b}}{a-\\sqrt{b}}\\nonumber \\\\[0.5em] -->\n<!-- &= \\dfrac{a-\\sqrt{b}}{(a+\\sqrt{b})(a-\\sqrt{b})}\\nonumber \\\\[0.5em] -->\n<!-- &= \\dfrac{a-\\sqrt{b}}{a^2+a\\sqrt{b}-a\\sqrt{b}-(\\sqrt{b})^2}\\nonumber \\\\[0.5em] -->\n<!-- &= \\dfrac{a-\\sqrt{b}}{a^2-b} -->\n<!-- \\end{align*} -->\n\n<!-- Now the fraction only has square roots in the numerator, this is better because it can often make expressions you are dealing with more concise. -->\n\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n:::{.callout-note appearance='simple'}\n## Example 5\n\nSolve $2^{x+1}\\cdot 3^x =72$. \n\nHere, you will need to condense the left-hand side into a single base. Using Law 1, you can write that $$2^{x+1}\\cdot 3^x = 2(2^x\\cdot 3^x) = 72.$$ Next, use Law 7 to combine $2^x$ and $3^x$ into a single base;\n$$2(2^x\\cdot 3^x) = 2((2\\cdot 3)^x) = 2\\cdot 6^x = 72.$$\nTherefore, $6^x = 36$. Since $36 = 6^2$, it follows that $x = 2$. (Or indeed, you could have taken logarithms of both sides to base $6$.)\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note appearance='simple'}\n## Example 6\n\nSolve $\\sqrt{(6x)^3}=8\\sqrt{27}$.\n\nFirst of all, you can use Law 7 to write $(6x)^3 = 6^3\\cdot x^3$. Using Law 10, you can then write the left hand side of this equation as $$\\sqrt{(6x)^3} = \\sqrt{6^3\\cdot x^3} = \\sqrt{6^3}\\cdot \\sqrt{x^3}$$ You can now work on $\\sqrt{6^3}$; using Law 7 and Law 10, you can write $$\\sqrt{6^3} = \\sqrt{2^3\\cdot 3^3} = \\sqrt{8}\\cdot \\sqrt{27}.$$ Therefore, the initial equation becomes $$\\sqrt{(6x)^3} = \\sqrt{8}\\cdot \\sqrt{27}\\cdot\\sqrt{x^3}=8\\sqrt{27}.$$ Dividing both sides by $\\sqrt{8}$ (thereby using Laws 2 and 6) and cancelling the $\\sqrt{27}$ gives $$\\sqrt{x^3} = \\frac{8}{\\sqrt{8}} = \\frac{8^1}{8^{1/2}} = 8^{1/2} = \\sqrt{8}.$$\nSquaring both sides to undo the square root gives $x^3 = 8$, and so $x = 2$.\n\n<!-- Here is a rather long example using multiple laws from this guide and the intro to indices guide. -->\n\n<!-- \\begin{align*} -->\n<!-- \\sqrt{(6x)^3}&=8\\sqrt{27}\\nonumber \\\\[0.5em] -->\n<!-- \\sqrt{x^3}\\cdot\\sqrt{6^3}&=8\\sqrt{27}\\tag{\\,Using Law 7 and Law 10} \\\\[0.5em] -->\n<!-- \\sqrt{x^3}\\cdot\\sqrt{(2\\cdot 3)^3}&=8\\sqrt{27}\\tag{\\,Using Law 7} \\\\[0.5em] -->\n<!-- \\sqrt{x^3}\\cdot\\sqrt{2^3}\\sqrt{3^3}&=8\\sqrt{27}\\tag{\\,Using Law 10} \\\\[0.5em] -->\n<!-- \\end{align*} -->\n<!-- to simplify the appearance of the calculation, swap $2^3$ for $8$ -->\n<!-- \\begin{align*} -->\n<!-- \\sqrt{x^3}\\cdot\\sqrt{8}\\sqrt{27}&=8\\sqrt{27}\\nonumber \\\\[0.5em] -->\n<!-- \\sqrt{x^3}\\cdot\\sqrt{8}&=8\\tag{\\,cancel $\\sqrt{27}$} \\\\[0.5em] -->\n<!-- \\sqrt{x^3}&=\\dfrac{8}{8^{1/2}}\\nonumber \\\\[0.5em] -->\n<!-- \\sqrt{x^3}&=\\sqrt{8}\\tag{\\,Using Law 2} \\\\[0.5em] -->\n<!-- \\end{align*} -->\n<!-- Finally, switch back to $2^3$ -->\n<!-- \\begin{align*} -->\n<!-- x^3&=8=2^3 -->\n<!-- \\end{align*} -->\n\n<!-- So $x=2$ is the final answer. -->\n\n:::\n\n## Examples involving logarithms {-}\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 7\n\nSolve $e^{3x}=12$.\n\nTaking the logarithm of both sides to base $e$ gives you $\\log_e(e^{3x})=\\log_e(12)$. Using the definition of logarithms, you can express the equation as $3x = \\ln(12)$. Rearranging the equation gives you $x=\\dfrac{\\ln(12)}{3}$ and this is your final answer.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\nAlthough $e$ here was treated as some constant, it is actually a very important constant called *Euler's number*.\n\nIn addition, there is a special name for $\\log_e(x)$; this is the **natural logarithm** of $x$, often written $\\ln(x)$.\n\nTo see more about Euler's number $e$ and natural logarithms, please read [Guide: Logarithms](logarithms.qmd).\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 8\n\nGiven the equation $6^x = 3^{x + 1}$, solve for $x$.\n\nFirst of all, you can notice that as $6$ is not a power of $3$ (or vice versa) getting these in the same base is difficult. What you can do instead is use the laws of indices to get an expression of the form $a^x = b$ and then take logarithms. Using Law 1, you can write that $$6^x = 3^x\\cdot 3^1 = 3(3^x)$$ Dividing both sides by $3^x$ and using Law 8 gives $$\\left(\\frac{6^x}{3^x}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{6}{3}\\right)^x = 3$$ and so you are left with $2^x = 3$. Taking logarithms of both sides to base $2$ gives $x = \\log_2(3)$; and this is your final answer!\n\n<!-- First, you can take the logarithm of both sides of the equation with base $a > 1$, $$\\log_a(3^x) = \\log_a(7^{x+1})$$ -->\n\n<!-- Next, using Law 3, you can bring the powers of the arguments outside of the logarithm as follows, $$x\\log_a(3) = (x+1)\\log_a(7)$$ -->\n\n<!-- After that, expand the right side of the equation to obtain $$x\\log_a(3) = x\\log_a(7) + \\log_a(7)$$ -->\n\n<!-- Subtracting $x\\log_a(7)$ from both sides of the equation gives you $$x\\log_a(3) - x\\log_a(7) = \\log_a(7)$$ From which you can pull a factor of $x$ out on the left, giving you $$x \\cdot (\\log_a(3) - \\log_a(7)) = \\log_a(7)$$ -->\n\n<!-- Finally, dividing both sides by $(\\log_a(3) - \\log_a(7))$, you conclude that $$x = \\frac{\\log_a(7)}{\\log_a(3) - \\log_a(7)}$$ -->\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 9\n\nGiven the equation $5^{2x} + 7(5^x) - 30 = 0$, you are asked to solve for $x$.\n\nStart by letting $y = 5^x$. Then, you can rewrite the equation given as $(5^x)^2 + 7(5^x) - 30 = 0$ using Law 3, which is the same as writing $$y^2 +7y - 30 = 0.$$\n\nRecognizing that this is a quadratic equation (see [Guide: Introduction to quadratic equations](introtoquadratics.qmd) for more), you can use the quadratic formula or otherwise to show that $$y = -10 \\quad \\textsf{or} \\quad y = 3.$$\n\nAs $y = 5^x$, this means that $5^x = -10$ or $5^x = 3$. By taking the logarithm of both sides to base $5$, you can show that $$x = \\log_5(-10) \\quad \\textsf{or} \\quad x = \\log_5(3).$$  Remember from above that the logarithm of a negative number is not defined, so $x = \\log_5(3)$ is the only viable solution.\n\n:::\n\nThe final example uses many of the laws of indices!\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 10\n\nSolve $3^{3x} = 5^{x-4}$.\n\nThis example is similar to Example 8, only with a few extra steps. Once again, as $3$ is not a power of $5$ or vice versa, the strategy is to write the equation in the form $a^x = b$ and then take logarithms of both sides. \n\nFirst of all, use Law 1 to write $5^{x-4} = 5^x\\cdot 5^{-4}$ and Law 3 to write $3^{3x} = (3^3)^x$. Since $3^3 = 27$, the equation becomes $$27^x = 5^x\\cdot 5^{-4}$$ Dividing both sides by $5^x$ gives $$\\frac{27^x}{5^x} = 5^{-4}$$ Using Law 8 and Law 5, you can write $$\\left(\\frac{27}{5}\\right)^x = \\frac{1}{5^4} = \\frac{1}{625}$$ Taking logarithms to base $27/5$ on both sides gives $x = \\log_{27/5}(1/625)$, which is your final answer.\n\n:::\n\n# Quick check problems {-}\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n::: {.webex-check .webex-box data-topic=\"SEE1\"}\n\n*If your answer is not a whole number, you should enter your answers as fractions $a/b$ and **not** decimals.*\n\n1.
