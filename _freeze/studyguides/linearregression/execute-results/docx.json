It is widely used in fields such as business, economics and social sciences.\ncategories:\n  - Statistics\nimage: FiguresPNG/linearregression-image.png\nfilters:\n  - shinylive\ndraft: true\n---\n\n\n\n*Before reading this guide, it is strongly recommended that you read [Guide: Introduction to straight lines] and [Guide: Expected value, variance, standard deviation](expectedvariance.qmd).*\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n```{=html}\n<table><tr><td style=\"vertical-align: middle\"><strong>Narration of study guide:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td><audio controls><source src=\"./Narrations/hypothesistesting.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio></tr></table>\n```\n\n:::\n\n# What is linear regression? {-}\n\nOne of the key purposes of statistics is the interpretation of data, which often involves considering the relationships between variables. Typically, this information is split into two categories: 'the thing which is observed' and 'the thing(s) which affect this observation', and a statistician collects information in both categories to build a full picture of the scenario. Then, the statistician tries to explain how and why a certain outcome is reached - which is incredibly useful for predicting which outcome may be reached in the future!\n\nFor instance, if the seaside branch of Cantor's Confectionery had 150 ice cream sales in one day, and only 30 in another, they may wish to understand what it was that motivated this change, so that they can have the appropriate number of ice creams in stock. It could be that one of these days was a warm, sunny, summer's Saturday, whilst the other was a cold, rainy winter's Monday. If you take a sample of the weather, season and day of the week and the corresponding number of ice cream sales across multiple days, you can build a model which allows you to predict the number of ice cream sales on a particular day.\n\nOne of the models which describes the relationship between variables is known as **linear regression**. Linear regression finds a line of best fit for your data, known as a **regression line**, which can be used to predict outcomes - like the number of ice cream sales.\n\nThis guide will introduce you to linear regression. It will explain how to apply a simple linear regression model to a sample of data by finding the regression line. It will also explore the practical applications of linear regression, including in the construction of confidence intervals which encapsulate the uncertainty about how closely your sample matches the real-world scenario, and in testing hypotheses about whether some factors impact the overall outcome.\n\n# Simple linear regression\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Definition of simple linear regression\n\n**Simple linear regression** is a linear regression model used when there is only one explanatory variable, $x$. The **regression line** predicts the value of the response variable, which is expressed as $\\mathbb{E}(Y)$. \n\nFor more on expected values, please see [Guide: Expected value, variance, standard deviation](expectedvariance.qmd). For more about explanatory and response variables, please see [Overview: Statistical Notation](../overviews/o-notation.qmd).\n\n:::\n\nTo find the equation of the regression line for a population of data, you will need to find the y-intercept of the line, which will be denoted by $\\alpha$, and its gradient, which will be described as $\\beta$. \n\nFor more about the equation of a straight line, please read [Guide: Introduction to straight lines].\n\nTherefore the equation of the regression line is given by:\n$$\\mathbb{E}(Y) = \\alpha + \\beta x$$\n\nIn practice, it is impractical to work with an entire population of data - instead, statisticians analyze samples. This means that you will need to obtain **estimates** for the values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ from your sample of data, and these will be denoted by $\\hat{\\alpha}$ and $\\hat{\\beta}$.\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n\n$\\hat{\\alpha}$ and  $\\hat{\\beta}$ are **unbiased** estimators of the population **regression parameters** $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, which means that their long-term averages are the same.\n\nFor more about biased estimators, please read [Guide: Biased and unbiased estimators].\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 1\n\nThe seaside branch of Cantor's Confectionery wishes to see the relationship between temperature ($x$) and ice cream sales ($y$). To do this, they track the number of ice cream sales in a 10 day period alongside the peak temperature that day.\n\n| Day number | Peak temperature (°C)    | Number of sales |\n|:-----------|:-------------------------|:----------------|\n| 1          | 22                       | 150             |\n| 2          | 20                       | 100             |\n| 3          | 19                       | 110             |\n| 4          | 21                       | 210             |\n| 5          | 24                       | 260             |\n| 6          | 25                       | 280             |\n| 7          | 27                       | 310             |\n| 8          | 26                       | 350             |\n| 9          | 28                       | 360             |\n| 10         | 25                       | 270             |\n\nYou can define $Y$ to be the random variable associated with observations $x$.

To find the values of the regression parameters which achieve this, you can use the method of least squares estimation.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Least squares estimation\n\n**Least squares estimation** is used to minimize the **sum of the squares of the residuals**, which is defined as $S(\\alpha,\\beta)$. \n\nYou consider the squares of the residuals ($e_{i}^{2}$) to ensure that the summed values are always positive.\n\nSo, considering the sum of each $e_{i}^{2}$, you will find:\n$$S(\\alpha,\\beta) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} e_{i}^{2} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_{i} - (\\alpha + \\beta x_{i}))^{2}$$\nThe **method of least squares** minimizes this function to find **estimates** (sometimes known as **point estimates**) for the **regression parameters**.

These are the estimates for the parameters. For more about derivatives, please read [Guide: Introduction to differentiation](introtodifferentiation.qmd).\n\nThe **least squares estimate** for the regression parameter $\\beta$ is defined as:\n\n$$\\hat{\\beta} = \\frac {SS_{XY}} {SS_{XX}} = \\frac{ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i} - \\bar{x})(y_{i} - \\bar{y})} { \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i} - \\bar{x})^{2}}$$\n\nThe **least squares estimate** for the regression parameter $\\alpha$ is defined as:\n\n$$\\hat{\\alpha} = \\bar{y} - \\hat{\\beta}\\bar{x}$$\n\nFor proofs of these results, please read [Proof sheet: Deriving estimates for regression parameters].\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\nWhen working with sums, you use programming languages such as R to save time manually typing each value into a calculator!\n:::\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 2\n\nUse the tool below to explore how changing the values of the **regression parameters** affects how close the estimated values $\\mathbb{E}(Y_i)$ are to the observed values $y_i$.

This reduces the complexity of the linear regression model, meaning it is more transferable to new data. \n\nFor more on this, please read [Guide: Introduction to Multiple Linear Regression].\n\n\n\n<!-- # Normal linear regression -->\n\n<!-- Suppose that you have a set of n observations. -->\n\n<!-- You previously saw that for $i \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $1 \\leq i \\leq n$,  -->\n<!-- $$\\mathbb{E}(Y_i) = \\alpha + \\beta x_{i}$$ -->\n\n<!-- As seen in [Overview: Statistical notation](../overviews/o-notation.qmd), this is equal to the sample mean. -->\n\n<!-- Now suppose that the variables $Y_{1}, ..., Y_{n}$ have variance $\\sigma^{2}$. -->\n\n<!-- Then, the distribution of the $i^{th}$ random variable $Y_{i}$ can be expressed as: -->\n<!-- $$Y _{i} \\sim N (\\alpha + \\beta x_{i} , \\sigma^{2})$$ -->\n\n\n<!-- ::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"} -->\n\n<!-- ## Assumptions for the normal linear regression model -->\n\n<!-- You must check that your data can be modelled using the normal distribution before you can use this model.
