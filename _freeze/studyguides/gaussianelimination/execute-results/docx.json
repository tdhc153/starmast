Using Gaussian Elimination you can solve systems of linear equations written as matrices.\ncategories: \n  - Linear mathematics \ndraft: true\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Before reading this guide, it is recommended that you read [Guide: Introduction to Matrices](introtomatrices.qmd)* *and [Guide: Introduction to fractions](introtofractions.qmd). For the last section of this guide (Using Gaussian elimination to solve systems of equations) it is recommended that you read [Guide: Introdution to Solving Simultaneous Equations](introtosimeqs.qmd)*.\n\nIn Introduction to Matrices you saw what a Matrix is and how to do arithmetic operations with it such as summing, subtracting and multiplying. In this guide, you will learn about operations that are done with the rows of the matrix to change the matrix.\n\n# What is Gaussian Elimination? {.unnumbered}\n\n**Gaussian Elimination** is a method used to transform matrices into 'nicer' forms so that you can get some information from the matrix. This nicer form is usually an 'upper triangle' where you only have non-zeros in the entries to right of the main diagonal, and the entries to the left are zeros (sometimes you can have more zeros than that). You can also use it to get the identity matrix. This guide will show you how to do Gaussian elimination and some of the applications of this technique. You will first study the row echelon form. Then you will learn the three types of row operations that you need to do Gaussian elimination. Finally you will discover the augmented matrix and how to apply Gaussian elimination to it to find the inverse of a matrix and solve many equations at once.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Definition of row echelon form and of reduced row echelon form\n\nA matrix is in row echelon form (or upper triangular form) if:\n\n(i)All the zero rows are at the bottom (this does not mean there are any zero rows!)\n\n(ii)The first entry in a (non-zero) row - this is the leading entry - is to the right of the first entry of the row above it.\n\n$$A = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & 3 & 3 \\\\\n0 & 5 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 9 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nThe leading entries of A are 2, 5 and 9.\n\nA matrix is in reduced row echelon form if:\n\n(i)In each non-zero row, the first entry of the row is 1, and\n\n(ii)In each column that contains a first entry for some row, all other entries in that column are zero.\n\n$$B =\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     1 & 0 & 3 \\\\\n     0 & 1 & 6 \\\\\n     0 & 0 & 0\n     \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nThe leading entries of B are the two 1s of the matrix and B has one zero-row.\n:::\n\n## Definition of elementary row operations (e.r.os)\n\nIn order to get to the (reduced) echelon form you have to do row operations. There are three elementary operations:\n\n(1)Multiplying a row number by a scalar $\\lambda$\n\nWhen multiplying a row number by a scalar you 'freeze' all the other rows of the matrix, and multiply the values of the row you have chosen by the scalar $\\lambda$. This gives you a modified matrix where only the row you choose to multiplicate has changed.\n\n(2)Add one multiple of one row to another row\n\nThis can be very useful when you want to get zeros in certain entries of your matrix. You can multiply one of the rows by a scalar $\\lambda$ and then add it or subtract it to another row.\n\n(3)Interchanging two rows\n\nAltering the order of the rows does not change the essential properties of the matrix. You can exchange the order of the rows in your matrix to get to the upper triangular form or to move the zero-rows to the bottom.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 1\n\nLet $$A=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n3 & 0 & 3 \\\\\n2 & 2 & 6 \\\\\n4 & 0 & 9\n\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nYou want to multiply the second row by 2:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}3 & 0 & 3  \\\\2 & 2 & 6  \\\\4 & 0 & 9  \\end{array}\\right] \\begin{matrix}r_2 \\to 2r_2 \\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}3 & 0 & 3  \\\\4 & 4 & 12  \\\\4 & 0 & 9\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nHence only the second row has changed and now is a scalar multiple of the original second row.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 2\n\nLet A be the same matrix as in Example 1. You can now try the second elementary row operation: add one multiple of one row to another row. Suppose you decide to add $\\frac{1}{2}r_2$ to $r_1$,you will be adding $[ 1 \\quad 1 \\quad 3 ]$ to $[3 \\quad 0 \\quad 3]$ such that:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}3 & 0 & 3  \\\\2 & 2 & 6  \\\\4 & 0 & 9  \\end{array}\\right] \\begin{matrix}r_1 \\to \\frac{1}{2}r_2 + r_1 \\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}4 & 1 & 6  \\\\4 & 4 & 12  \\\\4 & 0 & 9\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe matrix remains unchanged except for the first row, that is now a sum of the original row 1 and a half of row 2.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 3\n\nFinally you can interchange two rows. In this example you interchange row 3 and row 1.\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}3 & 0 & 3  \\\\2 & 2 & 6  \\\\4 & 0 & 9  \\end{array}\\right] \\begin{matrix}r_1 \\leftrightarrow r_3 \\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}4 & 0 & 9  \\\\2 & 2 & 6  \\\\3 & 0 & 3\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$\n:::\n\n# Reducing a matrix to echelon form (or reduced echelon form)\n\nYou can use elementary row operations to find the echelon form or the reduced echelon form a matrix.\n\nYou can do this in a series of steps:\n\n**Step 1**: Identify the zeros of your Matrix. If there are any all-zero rows interchange rows until all the zero rows are at the bottom of the matrix.\n\n**Step 2**: You can save some time if before doing other e.r.o.s you look at the leading entries of each row. Again interchange the rows of your Matrix until the first entry in each row is under or to the right of the first entry in the row above it.\n\n**Step 3**: Now it is time to start using other e.r.os. Focus on the leading entries, add or subtract multiples of different rows so that, for any leading entries in the same column, the lower leading entry becomes zero. Don't worry about having negative numbers or fractions in the other entries of such rows when you do this.\n\n**Step 4**: Repeat step 3 until you have the echelon form.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Tip\n\nThese steps are interchangeable and sometimes different steps work for different people! Maybe you prefer having all leading entries as single entries per column before you start interchanging rows, or you spot a e.r.o. that would work before another one. Many approaches can work!\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 4\n\nLet $$C=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n2 & 4 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nLook at row 3. It only has one entry and it is on the far left, you can use this to get 0 on the other entries of the first column and, since it only has one entry, you can focus on only that column for each operation you do with row 3. Start by doing this with row 1:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 1 & 1  \\\\2 & 4 & 0  \\\\1 & 0 & 0  \\end{array}\\right] \\begin{matrix}r_1 \\to r_1 - r_3 \\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}0 & 1 & 1  \\\\2 & 4 & 0  \\\\1 & 0 & 0 \\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nAnd now do the same for row 2. Note that because the leading entry of row 2 is 2, you need to multiply row 3 by a scalar 2 when you subtract it from row 2.\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}0 & 1 & 1  \\\\2 & 4 & 0  \\\\1 & 0 & 0  \\end{array}\\right] \\begin{matrix}r_1 \\to r_2 - 2r_3 \\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}0 & 1 & 1  \\\\0 & 4 & 0  \\\\1 & 0 & 0 \\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nGreat! Now there is only one entry on row 3, if we interchange row 1 and row 3, we can get the first line of the upper triangle form (left corner of the triangle)!\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}0 & 1 & 1  \\\\0 & 4 & 0  \\\\1 & 0 & 0  \\end{array}\\right] \\begin{matrix}r_1 \\leftrightarrow  r_3 \\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 0 & 0  \\\\0 & 4 & 0  \\\\0 & 1 & 1 \\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nNow, if you look at four, you can see that it only has one entry, in the middle column. This is good since it means you don't need to use the other rows to make sure the first entry is to the right of the row above it. Finally row 3 has its leading entry on the same column as the leading entry of 4, so you need to make that entry zero. To get the row echelon form, subtract $\\frac{1}{4}$ of row 2 from row 3:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 0 & 0  \\\\0 & 4 & 0  \\\\0 & 1 & 1 \\end{array}\\right] \\begin{matrix}r_3 \\to r_3 - \\frac{1}{4}r_2 \\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 0 & 0  \\\\0 & 4 & 0  \\\\0 & 0 & 1 \\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nSo the echelon form of C is $$C=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 4 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}$$\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 5\n\nLet $$D=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n5 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}$$Following the first step identify all the zeros of the matrix. Since the first row is a zero-row, you need to move it to the bottom. So the first e.r.o. you perform is interchanging rows:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n5 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1\\end{array}\\right] \\begin{matrix}r_1 \\leftrightarrow  r_3 \\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n5 & 2 & 2 \\\\0 & 0 & 0 \n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nNow row 1 has the most-left entry so it is ok for row echelon form. However, row 2 has its leading entry directly under the leading entry of row 1. To fix this, perform the second e.r.o., add a scalar multiple (-5) of row 1 to row 2.\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n5 & 2 & 2 \\\\0 & 0 & 0\\end{array}\\right] \\begin{matrix}r_2 \\to r_2 - 5r_1 \\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 2 & -3 \\\\0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nSo the row echelon form of D is\n\n$$\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 2 & -3 \\\\0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\n \n\n:::\n\nNow you will see a couple of examples where you get the reduced echelon form.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 6\n\nLet $$E=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n4 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n2 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 3 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nThere are no zero-rows in this matrix, so you can start looking at leading entries. Using the first entry of row 3 you can make the rest of the first column zero (you use row 3 because the leading is one). $$\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}4 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n2 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 3 & 0\\end{array}\\right] \\begin{matrix}r_2 \\to r_2 - 2r_3 \\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}4 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n0 & -4 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 3 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$ and similarly with row 1: $$\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}4 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n0 & -4 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 3 & 0\\end{array}\\right] \\begin{matrix}r_1 \\to r_1 - 4r_3 \\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}0 & -10 & 1 \\\\\n0 & -4 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 3 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right].\n\\end{aligned}$$ Since row 3 has the leading entry the most on the left, interchange it with row 1. $$\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}0 & -10 & 1 \\\\\n0 & -4 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 3 & 0\\end{array}\\right] \\begin{matrix}r_3 \\leftrightarrow r_1 \\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 3 & 0\\\\\n0 & -4 & 2 \\\\0 & -10 & 1 \n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$ Next you can divide row 2 by 2 to have it in a slightly nicer form:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 3 & 0\\\\\n0 & -4 & 2 \\\\0 & -10 & 1 \\end{array}\\right] \\begin{matrix}r_2 \\to \\frac{1}{2}r_2 \\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 3 & 0\\\\\n0 & -2 & 1 \\\\0 & -10 & 1 \n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nNow if you subtract (-5) times row 2 to row 3, you get the matrix in row echelon form: $$\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 3 & 0\\\\\n0 & -2 & 1 \\\\0 & -10 & 1 \\end{array}\\right] \\begin{matrix}r_3 \\to r_3 - 5r_2 \\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 3 & 0\\\\\n0 & -2 & 1 \\\\0 & 0 & -4 \n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nNow multiply row 3 by $\\frac{-1}{4}$ so that its first (and only) entry is 1\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 3 & 0\\\\\n0 & -2 & 1 \\\\0 & 0 & -4 \\end{array}\\right] \\begin{matrix}r_3 \\to \\frac{-1}{4}r_3 \\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 3 & 0\\\\\n0 & -2 & 1 \\\\0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right].\n\\end{aligned}$$ Subtract row 3 from row 2 to get rid of all the other entries in the column:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 3 & 0\\\\\n0 & -2 & 1 \\\\0 & 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right] \\begin{matrix}r_2 \\to r_2 -r_3 \\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 3 & 0\\\\\n0 & -2 & 0 \\\\0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$ Similar to how you did it for row 3, we multiply row 2 by $\\frac{-1}{2}$ to have a leading entry 1.\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 3 & 0\\\\\n0 & -2 & 0 \\\\0 & 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right] \\begin{matrix}r_2 \\to \\frac{-1}{2}r_2 \\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 3 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$ Finally use row 2 to eliminate all other non-zero entries in the second column (i.e. where the leading entry of row 2 is)\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 3 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\0 & 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right] \\begin{matrix}r_1 \\to r_1 - 3r_2\\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right].\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThis is in the reduced echelon form since every line has only one entry, there is only one leading entry per column, and all leading entries are 1.\n\n:::\n\nNow you can try an example with a matrix that is larger. This usually means more e.r.o.s!\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 7\n\nLet $$F=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 6 & 0 & 3\\\\\n2 & 1 & 2 & 1\\\\\n0 & 2 & 0 & 1\\\\\n1 & 2 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}.$$\n\nThis matrix is larger than the ones in the previous examples, but the method is still the same! You can start by looking at the zeros to choose how to order your rows. Notice that row 4 has a leading entry of one and the last two entries are zeros, so this could be a good first row! We exchange it with row 1:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}0 & 6 & 0 & 3\\\\\n2 & 1 & 2 & 1\\\\\n0 & 2 & 0 & 1\\\\\n1 & 2 & 0 & 0\\end{array}\\right] \\begin{matrix}r_1 \\leftrightarrow r_4 \\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}1 & 2 & 0 & 0\\\\\n2 & 1 & 2 & 1\\\\\n0 & 2 & 0 & 1\\\\\n0 & 6 & 0 & 3\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nNow if you look at the two bottom rows you can see that they are multiples of each other (row 4 is three times row 3), so you can subtract one from the other to get a zero-row. $$\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}1 & 2 & 0 & 0\\\\\n2 & 1 & 2 & 1\\\\\n0 & 2 & 0 & 1\\\\\n0 & 6 & 0 & 3\\end{array}\\right] \\begin{matrix}r_4 \\to r_4 - 3r_3\\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}1 & 2 & 0 & 0\\\\\n2 & 1 & 2 & 1\\\\\n0 & 2 & 0 & 1\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nYou want all the entries in the first column to be zero except for the first row, so we subtract the first row to the second: $$\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}1 & 2 & 0 & 0\\\\\n2 & 1 & 2 & 1\\\\\n0 & 2 & 0 & 1\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\end{array}\\right] \\begin{matrix}r_2 \\to r_2 - 2r_2\\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}1 & 2 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & -3 & 2 & 1\\\\\n0 & 2 & 0 & 1\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$ To get 0 in all the entries in the column where -3 is the leading entry, we add $\\frac{2}{3}r_2$ to row 3:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}1 & 2 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & -3 & 2 & 1\\\\\n0 & 2 & 0 & 1\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\end{array}\\right] \\begin{matrix}r_3 \\to r_3 + \\frac{2}{3}r_2\\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}1 & 2 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & -3 & 2 & 1\\\\\n0 & 0 & \\frac{4}{3} & \\frac{5}{3}\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\n\nIf you prefer not working with fractions when doing e.r.o.s, you can multiply all the entries in your row by a scalar and this will not change the result!\n\n\nMultiply row 3 by 3 to get rid of fractional expressions: $$\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}1 & 2 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & -3 & 2 & 1\\\\\n0 & 0 & \\frac{4}{3} & \\frac{5}{3}\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\end{array}\\right] \\begin{matrix}r_3 \\to 3r_3 \\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}1 & 2 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & -3 & 2 & 1\\\\\n0 & 0 & 4 & 5\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nFor the reduced row echelon form you need all leading entries to be one and all the columns with a leading entry to be 0 everywhere except the leading entry. If you look at the matrix so far, the leading entries you have to change are -3 and 4. You also need the third entry of the second row to be zero and the second entry in the first row to be 0. Start by subtracting $\\frac{1}{2}$ $r_3$ to $r_2$: $$\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}1 & 2 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & -3 & 2 & 1\\\\\n0 & 0 & 4 & 5\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\end{array}\\right] \\begin{matrix}r_2 \\to r_2 - \\frac{1}{2}r_3 \\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}1 & 2 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & -3 & 0 & \\frac{-3}{2}\\\\\n0 & 0 & 4 & 5\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nNow try doing two operations at once. Divide row 2 by $\\frac{-1}{3}$ to get a leading entry of 1 and add $\\frac{2}{3}$ of (the old) row 2 to row 1 to eliminate all non-zero entries in column two that are not leading entries such that: $$\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}1 & 2 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & -3 & 0 & \\frac{-3}{2}\\\\\n0 & 0 & 4 & 5\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\end{array}\\right] \\begin{matrix}r_2 \\to \\frac{-1}{3}r_2 \\\\ r_1 \\to r_1 + \\frac{2}{3}r_2 \\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}1 & 0 & 0 & -1\\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & \\frac{1}{2}\\\\\n0 & 0 & 4 & 5\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$ Finally divide row 3 by 4 to get a leading entry of one: $$\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}1 & 0 & 0 & -1\\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & \\frac{1}{2}\\\\\n0 & 0 & 4 & 5\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\end{array}\\right] \\begin{matrix}r_2 \\to r_2 - \\frac{1}{2}r_3 \\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}1 & 0 & 0 & -1\\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & \\frac{1}{2}\\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & \\frac{5}{4}\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right].\n\\end{aligned}$$ Since you have only non-zero entries in the upper triangle, all leading entries are 1 and the columns with leading entries have 0 on every other entry, the matrix is in the reduced echelon form.\n:::\n\n# Using the row echelon form to find the inverse of a matrix\n\n::: callout-note\n## Definition of the Augmented Matrix\n\nYou construct the augmented matrix of a matrix A by combining it with any other matrix which has the same number of rows as A.

Then we can build the augmented matrix M' of M with the identity matrix $I_n$ such that: $$\\begin{aligned} M'=\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc|cc} 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 3 & 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$\n:::\n\nTo find the inverse of matrices using e.r.o.s you use Gaussian Elimination on the extended matrix (with the identity matrix) of the matrix whose inverse you want to find.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Warning\n\nYou can only invert matrices that are square (same number of rows and columns), so this strategy also works only with square matrices!\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\n## E.r.o.s on extended matrices\n\nWhen performing elementary row operations on an extended matrix, each row operation acts equally on both sides of the extended matrix. That is, if you do e.r.o.s on the left block you have to do the same e.r.o.s on the right block.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 8\n\nLet $$\\begin{aligned}G=\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 4 & 7 \\\\ 2 & 6\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$ be the matrix you want to invert. You start by extending it such that:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}G'=\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc|cc}\n4 & 7 & 1 & 0\\\\\n2 & 6 & 0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right].\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nNow you want to perform e.r.o.s until the left block is $I_2$. First subtract row 2 to row 1 so as to get a zero above the leading entry of row 1:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc|cc}\n4 & 7 & 1 & 0\\\\\n2 & 6 & 0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\\begin{matrix}r_1 \\to r_1 - 2r_2 \\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{cc|cc}0 & -5 & 1 & -2\\\\\n2 & 6 & 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right].\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nYou can multiply row 1 by $\\frac{-1}{5}$ to get the left block in the right form:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc|cc}\n0 & -5 & 1 & -2\\\\\n2 & 6 & 0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\\begin{matrix}r_1 \\to r_1 - 2r_2 \\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{cc|cc}0 & 1 & \\frac{-1}{5} & \\frac{2}{5}\\\\\n2 & 6 & 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nNow you will do two operations at the same time: first, you will multiply row 2 by $\\frac{1}{2}$ to get a leading entry of one, then you will exchange row 1 and row 2 to have the diagonal of 1s you need for the identity matrix form:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc|cc}0 & 1 & \\frac{-1}{5} & \\frac{2}{5}\\\\\n2 & 6 & 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\\begin{matrix}r_1 \\to r_2 - \\frac{1}{2}r_2 \\\\ r_1 \\leftrightarrow r_2 \\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{cc|cc}\n1 & 3 & 0 & \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 0 & 1 & \\frac{-1}{5} & \\frac{2}{5}\\\\\\end{array}\\right].\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nFinally you subtract 3 times row 2 to row 1 to get rid of the non-zero values in the column of the leading entry:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc|cc}1 & 3 & 0 & \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ 0 & 1 & \\frac{-1}{5} & \\frac{2}{5}\\end{array}\\right]\\begin{matrix}r_1 \\to r_1 - 3r_2 \\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{cc|cc}\n1 & 0 & \\frac{3}{5} & \\frac{-7}{10} \\\\ 0 & 1 & \\frac{-1}{5} & \\frac{2}{5}\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nSince you have the identity matrix in the left block, this means the matrix you have in the right block is the inverse of G! So\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}G^{-1}=\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} \\frac{3}{5} & \\frac{7}{10} \\\\ \\frac{-1}{5} & \\frac{2}{5}\\end{array}\\right].\n\\end{aligned}$$\n:::\n\nNow you will see another example with a bigger matrix, where the identity matrix you will use is $I_3$ instead of $I_2$\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 9\n\nThe square matrix you want to invert is\n\nH= $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 3 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 6 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 3 & 3\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nSo the extended matrix will be:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} H' =\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|ccc} 1 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 6 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 0\\\\ 1 & 3 & 3 & 0 & 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$ You can see that row 1 has a leading entry of 1, this is good because we can use that to make all the other entries in the first column 0. Row 2 has already 0, this is good! Now subtract row 1 to row 3 to have zero in the first column (notice by doing this you will also get a zero in the second column, which is helpful since row 3 only needs a non-zero entry in the third column).\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|ccc}1 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 6 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 0\\\\ 1 & 3 & 3 & 0 & 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\\begin{matrix}r_1 \\to r_3 - r_1 \\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|ccc}1 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 6 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe only non zero entry in row 3 is the leading entry in the third column, row 3 is ready! Now you want to have row 2 in 'identity form' too. To do this, use row 3. Again you can do two e.r.o.s at the same time. First, subtract two times row 3 to row 2 to get a zero in the third entry, then divide row 2 by six so that the leading entry of the row is 1:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|ccc}1 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 6 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\\begin{matrix}r_2 \\to r_2 - 2r_3 \\\\ r_2 \\to \\frac{1}{6}r_2 \\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|ccc}1 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & \\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{1}{6} & -\\frac{1}{3}\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$ So row 2 is also in the right form! Now you need to get row 1 in the right form (make all non leading entries 0). Start by using row 2 to make the second entry 0: $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|ccc}1 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & \\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{1}{6} & -\\frac{1}{3}\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\\begin{matrix}r_1 \\to r_1 - 3r_2 \\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|ccc}1 & 0 & 2 & 0 & -\\frac{1}{2} & 1\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & \\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{1}{6} & -\\frac{1}{3}\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nAlmost there! Now subtract two times row 3 to row 1 and you will get 'identity form' in row 1:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|ccc}1 & 0 & 2 & 0 & -\\frac{1}{2} & 1\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & \\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{1}{6} & -\\frac{1}{3}\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\\begin{matrix}r_1 \\to r_1 - 2r_3 \\end{matrix} & \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc|ccc}1 & 0 & 0 & 2 & -\\frac{1}{2} & -1\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & \\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{1}{6} & -\\frac{1}{3}\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe left block is the identity matrix form, so you are done! Now the inverse of H is given by the right block. So\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}H^{-1}= \n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 2 & -\\frac{1}{2} & -1 \\\\ \\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{1}{6} & -\\frac{1}{3} \\\\-1 & 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$\n:::\n\n# Using Gaussian elimination to solve systems of equations\n\nYou can use inverse matrices to solve systems of linear equations, following these steps:\n\n**Step 1** Write the system of linear equations as a matrix, by writing the coefficients of each variable as an entry in the matrix (each column corresponds to one variable), the variables X as a column vector and the coefficients (on the other side of the equality of each equation) as another column vector.\n\n**Step 2** Find the inverse of the matrix using the row echelon form.\n\n**Step 3** Perform matrix multiplication to find X, where X is an array giving the solution to all the variables.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Why does this work?\n\nIf A is the matrix with all the coefficients of the system of linear equations, and X is the $(1 \\times n)$ vector with all the variables the matrix has, the system can be written as:\n\n$AX = B$. By multiplying both sides by the inverse $A^{-1}$ we get:\n\n$A^{-1}AX = A^{-1}B$. But we know by definition of the inverse matrix that $A^{-1}A = I_n$ so\n\n$I_n X= A^{-1} B$, and by definition of the identity matrix $I_n X = X$.\n\nSo the solution to the array of variables X is:\n\n$X = A^{-1}B$. Since you know be, by finding $A^{-1}$ you can get the solution to the system of equations.\n:::\n\nThe following examples use the inverses of previous examples to show how this can work:\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 10\n\nSuppose you have this system of equations:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned} 4x + 7y = 1 \\\\ 2x + 6y = 0\\end{aligned}$$\n\nFollowing the steps above, start by taking the coefficients of the variables in the system and organising them by columns. So in the first column you will the coefficients of the x variable (that is, 4 and 2) and in the second column you will have the coefficients of the y variable (that is, 2 and 6):\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} 4 & 7 \\\\ 2 & 6\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nNotice this is the same matrix as G from example 8! So, we know its inverse is:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}G^{-1}=\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc} \\frac{3}{5} & \\frac{7}{10} \\\\ \\frac{-1}{5} & \\frac{2}{5}\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nB is given by the constants of the system of equations, so B=$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1\\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nSimilarly as X depends on the variables, X= $$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx\\\\\ny\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nNow that you have $X$, $B$, $G$ and $G^{-1}$, we can find the values of the variables! Recall you will use the equation $GX = B$ to get $X = G^{-1}B$.\n\nSo you have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n4 & 7 \\\\\n2 & 6\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny\n\\end{bmatrix}\n&=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow multiply both sides by the inverse:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{3}{5} & \\frac{7}{10} \\\\ \\frac{-1}{5} & \\frac{2}{5} \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n4 & 7 \\\\\n2 & 6\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny\n\\end{bmatrix}\n&=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{3}{5} & \\frac{7}{10} \\\\ \\frac{-1}{5} & \\frac{2}{5} \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 \\\\0\n\\end{bmatrix} \\end{aligned}$$\n\nSince $A^{-1}A = I_n$ and $I_nX = X$, this gives:\n\n$$ \\begin{aligned}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny\n\\end{bmatrix}\n&=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\frac{3}{5} & \\frac{7}{10} \\\\ \\frac{-1}{5} & \\frac{2}{5} \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n= \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{3}{5} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{5} \\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{aligned} $$\n\nSo you can solve $$x= \\frac{3}{5}$$ and $$y = -\\frac{1}{5}$$.\n:::\n\nAnother option is to turn your system of linear equations into an extended matrix, where the left block represents the coefficients of the variables and the right block represents the constants, and with Gaussian elimination turn the left block into the reduced echelon form. Then you can rewrite the system of equations with the new coefficients and the new constants and solve for the variables (start from the bottom, there is at least one row with just one entry in the left block). To show this, you will work through an example with a matrix you have already seen, but this time you will be doing the e.r.o.s on the augmented form.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 11\n\nWe want to solve this system of equations:\\\\ $4x + 2y = 1 \\\\ 2x + 2y =2 \\\\ x + 3y = 0$. Let's build the augmented matrix, the left block is given by the coefficients so: $$E_{Left}=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n4 & 2  \\\\\n2 & 2  \\\\\n1 & 3 \n\\end{bmatrix}$$ where the first column gives the values of the coefficients of the x-variables and the second column gives the values of the y-variables.\n\nNow you can obtain the right block from the coefficients: $$E_{Right}=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1  \\\\\n2  \\\\\n0\n\\end{bmatrix}$$ Now we combine the two in the augmented matrix: $$\\begin{aligned}\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc|c}4 & 2& 1\\\\ 2 & 2 & 2\\\\ 1 & 3 & 0\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nNotice this is the matrix from **Example 6**: $$E=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n4 & 2 & 1 \\\\\n2 & 2 & 2 \\\\\n1 & 3 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}$$ with slightly different notation (two blocks instead of one).\n\nBut this does not change how we get the row echelon form, since with e.r.o.s we perform the same operation simultaneously on both blocks. In fact, with e.r.o.s we 'ignore' the middle bar making the matrix. It is just there to remind us which part corresponds to the coefficients, and which part corresponds to the constants at the other side of the equality.\n\nSo, if we do the same e.r.o.s as in **Example 6** we get: $$\\begin{aligned}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc|c}1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nRemember the first column gives the x-variable coefficients and the second column gives the y-variable coefficients, so we get:\n\n$x + 0y = 0 \\\\ 0x + y = 0 \\\\ 0x + 0y= 0$, which is a contradiction, so the system has no solutions.\n:::\n\nThe `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).\n\n# Further reading {.unnumbered}\n\n[For more questions on the subject, please go to Questions: Gaussian elimination.]\n\n[For an introduction on matrices, please see Guide: Introduction to Matrices.](introtomatrices.qmd) \n\n[For an introduction systems of linear equations, please see Guide: Solving systems of linear equations.]\n\n## Version history {.unnumbered}\n\nv1.0: initial version created 04/25 by sdg.\n\n[This work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/?ref=chooser-v1)",
