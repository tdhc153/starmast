This will guide introduce the concept and take you through how to undo common operations like addition, multiplication, and powers.\ncategories:\n  - Key skills\n  - Algebra\nimage: FiguresPNG/introtorearrange-image.png\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<!-- *Before reading this guide, it is recommended that you read [Guide: Introduction to quadratic equations](introtoquadratics.qmd)* -->\n\n# Introduction {-}\n\nMathematical formulas are used in all walks of life. From converting between temperature scales, to working out volumes of spheres, these are important mathematical expressions often linking two or more variables. Being able to manipulate these mathematical expressions could allow you to extract information and solve for specific variables. This concept of **rearranging an equation** is vital in handling mathematical formulas, solving all sorts of equations (linear, quadratic, simultaneous, vector), and much much more. It is a crucial tool in almost any academic subject that handles numbers or data. \n\nThis guide will introduce you to rearranging equations by stipulating the golden rule of rearranging equations, demonstrate how certain pairs of mathematical operations 'undo' each other, and explain strategies and techniques for rearranging even the most complicated looking formulas.\n\n<!-- It is useful to be able to rearrange an equation to focus on a specific variable. For this guide we will refer to the specific variable as the 'subject' of the equation. -->\n\n<!-- To rearrange an equation to make a variable the subject of the equation you may need to 'undo' certain operations which are applied to the equation. -->\n\n<!-- Additionally, when rearranging equations, commutative, associative and distributive laws are important.  -->\n\n# The golden rule of rearranging equations {-}\n\nThe **golden rule of rearranging equations** is the following. \n\n::: {.callout-important}\n**You must treat both sides of an equation exactly the same.**\n:::\n\nThis means if you add $5xy$ to one side an equation, you must add $5xy$ to the other side of the equation. If you multiply one side of an equation by $189273$, you must multiply the other side of the equation by $189273$. If you divide both sides of an equation by $2lp$, then... well, you get the picture.\n\nThe reason for this is balance. Suppose that $x = 2$. If you wanted to multiply the left hand side by $2$ but not the right hand side, you would end up with $2x = 2$. But as you can see here, this has changed the assumption that $x = 2$, as in this case $x$ is now equal to $1$! So to preserve equality in the expression, you must follow the golden rule of rearranging equations. \n\n<!-- ### Why it is useful to be able to rearrange equations -->\n\n<!-- Rearranging equations can be useful. You may want to rearrange an equation to get an expression for a specific value which can be then solved by substitution. -->\n<!--  e.g $x = \\sqrt{45y}$ -->\n\n\n<!-- You may also have multiple equations where rearranging an equation allows for a substitution. -->\n\n<!-- For example -->\n\n<!-- ::: {.callout-note} -->\n<!-- ## Example 1 -->\n<!-- Consider the following simultaneous equations -->\n\n<!-- $$1)\\quad x + y = 4z$$ -->\n\n<!-- $$2)\\quad \\frac{5z}{x} + \\frac{1}{x} = 5 + 5\\frac{y}{x}$$ -->\n\n\n<!-- the second equation can be simplified by a number of steps  -->\n\n<!-- $$ \\frac{1}{x}(5z + 1) = 5 + 5\\frac{y}{x} $$ -->\n\n<!-- $$ \\frac{1}{x}(5z + 1) = 5(1 + \\frac{y}{x}) $$ -->\n\n<!-- $$ \\frac{1}{5}(5z + 1) = x(1 + \\frac{y}{x}) $$ -->\n\n<!-- $$ \\frac{1}{5}(5z + 1) = x + y $$ -->\n\n<!-- As we have another expression for $x+y$ above $x+y=4z$ we can substitute $4z$ into the simplified expression above to get -->\n\n<!-- $$ \\frac{1}{5} (5z + 1) = 4z$$ -->\n\n<!-- which further simplifies to -->\n\n<!-- $$ z + \\frac{1}{5} = 4z$$ -->\n\n<!-- $$ 3z = \\frac{1}{5}$$ -->\n\n<!-- $$ z = \\frac{1}{15}$$ -->\n\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n# Undoing operations {-}\n\nSuppose you are given an expression like $$5x^3y^3 + \\frac{6z}{w^4} = 4abc^2$$ How would you go about rearranging this equation to something of the form $x = \\ldots$? This process is known as **rearranging for $x$** or **making $x$ the subject of the equation**. You can notice that in the above equation, $x$ has been raised to the power of $3$, it has been multiplied by both $5$ and $y^3$, and it has been added to $6z/w^4$. To make $x$ the subject of the equation, you will need to 'undo' the operations on $x$ until only a single instance of $x$ remains.\n\nThe premise of rearranging equations is to 'undo' what operations have been applied to a particular variable to express that variable on its own. This guide will focus on the following three pairs of operations:\n\n- addition and subtraction\n- multiplication and division\n- powers of $n$ and $n$th roots, where $n$ is some number not equal to $0$ or $1$. \n\nOf these\n\n- subtraction 'undoes' addition and addition 'undoes' subtraction\n- division 'undoes' multiplication and multiplication 'undoes' division\n- taking the $n$th root 'undoes' raising to the power of $n$, and raising to the power of $n$ 'undoes' taking the $n$th root.\n\nThe *order* of undoing these operations is often critical. Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division involve **two numbers**, but raising to the power of $n$ and taking $n$th roots involves **one number**. These properties influence the order in which you should undo operations and therefore rearrange the equation. You should keep these properties in mind as you study the content in the guide.\n\n## Addition and subtraction {-}\n\nThe reason why you can undo addition by subtraction (and subtraction by addition) is because anything added to $0$ is itself. It is best to see this behaviour in an example: Example 1 uses subtraction to rearrange an equation in $x$.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Example 1\nGiven the equation $x + a = b$ you can make $x$ the subject of the equation by\nsubtracting the variable $a$ from both sides of the equation (remembering the golden rule!)\n\nThis will give you\n\n$$x + a − a = b − a$$\n\nSince $a-a = 0$, the equation becomes $$x + 0 = b - a$$ Since $x + 0 = x$ for any number $x$, you can write that\n\n$$x = b − a$$ and since $x$ is isolated on the left hand side, you have finished.\n:::\n\nExample 1 is written in lots of detail to explain what is going on. In practice, you will not need to be this thorough in your working. \n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Example 2\n\nIf you want to make $x$ the subject of the equation $x − 8 = ab$ you can add\n$8$ to both sides. \n\nDoing this gives you\n\n$$x − 8 + 8 = ab + 8$$\n\nwhich simplifies to\n\n$$x = ab + 8$$\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nGoing forward, you may not even have to write the middle step of Example 2; you can start with $x - 8 = ab$ and go straight to $x = ab + 8$. This is an example of natural progression in mathematics; once a concept has been mastered, then you can use it without specifying details in future.\n:::\n\n## Multiplication and division {-}\n\nThe reason why you can undo multiplication with division (and division with multiplication) is that any number multiplied by $1$ is itself. However, the following health warning applies:\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n*Most of the time*, you can undo multiplication in an equation by division. The only time you are not able to do this is if you divide by $0$; which is strictly forbidden in mathematics and carries a heavy punishment. The expression $0/0$ is **undefined and should not be written**.\n:::\n\nThe example below uses division to 'undo' the multiplication in the equation in $x$. As with Example 1, this example uses more detail than is necessary to illustrate the concepts involved.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Example 3\nGiven the equation $8x = 9$, you can make $x$ the subject by dividing both sides\nby $8$ (which is not equal to $0$). Doing this gives\n\n$$\\frac{8x}{8} = \\frac{9}{8}$$\n\nThis can then be simplified. As $\\dfrac{8}{8}$ is equal to 1, the expression simplifies to $$1\\cdot x = \\frac{8}{9}$$\n\nwhich, as $1\\cdot x = 1$ for all numbers $x$, can be simplified to \n\n$$x = \\frac{8}{9}$$\nand since $x$ is on its own on the left-hand side, you are finished.\n\n:::\n\nSimilarly, you can undo division in an equation by using multiplication. Since no equation will ever be divided by $0$ to begin with, you can always undo division. \n\nThis next example combines what you have learned so far.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Example 4\nHow do you make $x$ the subject of the equation $\\dfrac{3}{4}x + a = 6$?\n\nIn fact, you have a little bit of flexibility in this question. One way you can do it is isolate a multiple of $x$ on one side by subtracting by $a$ first. Doing this gives $$\\frac{3}{4}x = 6 - a$$ You know that you can undo the division of $x$ by $4$ by multiplying both sides of the equation by $4$. Here, that you have to multiply **all** of the right hand side by $4$; this includes both terms $6$ and $-a$. This is an important step; as if you don't do this, you are violating the golden rule in not treating both sides of the equation exactly the same! To make sure you do not fall into this trap, it can be useful to use brackets to ensure everything on the right-hand side is multiplied by $4$. Anyway, the next step in the rearranging is $$3x = 4(6-a)$$ Now, dividing both sides by $3$ (making sure to divide *everything* on the right-hand side by $3$) gives $$x = \\frac{4(6-a)}{3}$$ and you are done.\n:::\n\nThere are many ways to do this question. You could do the division by $3$ first, then the subtraction by $a/3$, then the multiplication by $4$. Here, the order of operations doesn't matter so much, but isolating a multiple of the chosen variable on one side is often the best way to go about rearranging equations.\n\nThis forms the basis of the general strategy for rearranging any equation:\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nWhen rearranging an equation for a variable, try to get exactly one term involving that variable on one side of the equation; then do what you need to do to isolate that variable.\n:::\n\nIt is also worth restating:\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nWhen multiplying/dividing one side of an equation by a number $a$, make sure to multiply/divide **everything** on that side of an equation by $a$.\n:::\n\nThis is a common health warning in rearranging equations, as you will see throughout the rest of the guide.\n\n<!-- In this case it is the addition of the variable $a$.  -->\n<!-- You can remove it from the right hand side of the equation by subtracting it from both sides.  -->\n\n<!-- This gives us  -->\n\n<!-- $$\\frac{3}{4}x + a - a = 6 - a$$ -->\n\n<!-- which simplifies to -->\n\n<!-- $$\\frac{3}{4}x = 6 - a$$ -->\n\n<!-- Now in order to get rid of the fraction on the right hand side you first multiply -->\n<!-- the whole equation by the denominator 4, giving you -->\n\n<!-- $$3x = (6 − a)*4$$ -->\n\n<!-- $$3x = 24 − 4a$$ -->\n\n<!-- Then finally you divide both sides of the equation by 3 to get -->\n<!-- $$x = 8 − \\frac{4}{3}a$$ -->\n\n<!-- Tip: Make sure that whatever action you do to one side of the equation you -->\n<!-- do to the other. For example, if you multiply one side of the equation by -->\n<!-- 3, you have to multiply the other side by 3 as well. -->\n\n\n\n\n## Powers and roots {-}\n\n#### Undoing powers of $n$ using $n$th roots {-}\n\nHow would you undo a power such as $x^2 = 9$, $y^3 = 64$ or even $x^n = a$ (where $n\\geq 2$ is a whole number)? \n\nThe idea is to use roots. However, there are some considerations to be made when taking the $n$th root of an equation.\n\nTake the first of these examples, which is $x^2 = 9$. Here, you are trying to rearrange for $x$, where $x$ is some number than when squared gives $9$. You would immediately think that $x = 3$, and you'd be right; but $x$ could *also* be $-3$. How do you account for this? The idea is to use the square root symbol $\\sqrt{\\;}$, but $x = \\sqrt{9}$ can't be two solutions at once. To get around this, you could define the square root symbol to **always** mean the *positive* square root of a number, and write $\\pm$ to mean 'plus or minus'. Therefore, if $x^2=9$, then $x = \\pm \\sqrt{9} = \\pm 3$ to rearrange for $x$.\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\nThe square root of a negative number is **not** a real number. If you want to rearrange an equation like $x^2 = -4$ for $x$, then you will need to use **complex numbers**. See [Guide: Introduction to complex numbers] for more.\n\nComplex numbers are not considered in the rest of this guide.\n:::\n\nSo, what about $y^3 = 64$? Here there is only one number that when cubed is equal to $64$; this number is $4$. This is because $(-4)^3 = -64$. So in fact, you are able to take the *cube root* $\\sqrt[3]{\\;}$ of any number and not have to worry about signs; if $y^3 = 64$ then $y = \\sqrt[3]{64} = 4$. You can contrast this to the case of the square roots!\n\nNow, what about $x^n = a$? If $n$ is even, then $x^n$ must be a square number, and so must be positive. In addition, if $n$ is even then $(-x)^n = x^n$, and so you must also take positive and negative roots.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Undoing powers using $n$th roots\nSuppose that $x^n = a$.\n\n- If $n$ is even and $a \\geq 0$, then $$x = \\pm\\sqrt[n]{a}$$ where $\\sqrt[n]{a}$ is the positive $n$th root of $a$.\n\n- If $n$ is odd, then $$x = \\sqrt[n]{a}$$ where $\\sqrt[n]{a}$ is the $n$th root of $a$.\n:::\n\nThankfully, the situation of undoing $n$th roots using powers of $n$ is not as complex (no pun intended!). Since there is no ambiguity about the sign of an $n$th root, you can raise to the power of $n$ to undo the root in any case:\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Undoing $n$th roots using powers of $n$\nSuppose that $\\sqrt[n]{x} = a$. Then $x = a^n$. \n:::\n\nWhen rearranging equations involving powers of $n$ and $n$th roots, you should *always* aim to isolate your variable on one side before undoing the power of $n$ or the $n$th root. This is because:\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nIn general, $$a^n + b^n \\neq (a+b)^n \\quad\\textsf{ and }\\quad\\sqrt[n]{a} + \\sqrt[n]{b} \\neq \\sqrt[n]{a+b}$$\n:::\n\n<!-- ::: {.callout-note} -->\n<!-- ## Example 6 -->\n<!-- Suppose you want to make $x$ the subject of the equation $x^a = b$, you take the $a^{th}$ root of both sides.  -->\n<!-- This gives you -->\n<!-- $$x = ± \\sqrt[a]{b}$$ -->\n\n<!-- • Tip:  Make sure when you take the root of a power, you are aware of what sign the value is. For a square root, the value could have a positive or negative sign. -->\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Example 5\nYou are given the equation $2z = 4x^2 + 5y$. To make $x$ the subject of this equation, you should isolate $4x^2$ on one side of the equation like so:\n\n$$4x^2 = 5y − 2z$$\nNow, to apply the square root, you need to have $x^2$ on its own. So divide by $4$ to get\n\n$$x^2 = \\frac{5y-2z}{4}$$\nNow you can then take the square root of both sides to get\n\n$$x = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{5y − 2z}{4}}$$\nand this is your answer.\n\n:::\n\nFor roots in equations, you can use inverse operation of taking the equation to a power.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Example 6\nIf you want to make $x$ the subject of the equation $\\displaystyle \\sqrt[5]{\\frac{x^3}{2}} = b-1$, you need to undo the fifth root around $x^3/2$. This can be done by raising both sides to the power of $5$. Following the health warning above, you must remember to raise **everything** on the right hand side to the power of $5$. Doing this gives\n$$\\frac{x^3}{2} = (b-1)^5$$\nYou cannot take cube roots yet however, because of that $2$. Multiplying $2$ from both sides gives $$x^3 = 2(b-1)^5.$$ *Now* you can cube root to get $$x = \\sqrt[3]{2(b-1)^5}$$ and you are done. \n\n:::\n\nFinally, let's return to the initial example at the start of the guide. \n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Example 7\nLet's take $$5x^3y^3 + \\frac{6z}{w^4} = 4abc^2$$ How do you rearrange for $x$?\n\nFirst of all, you need to isolate the term involving $x$ on one side of the equation. You can subtract $6z/w^4$ from both sides of the equation to get $$5x^3y^3 = 4abc^2 - \\frac{6z}{w^4}$$\nYou now need to get a power of $x$ on its own by dividing through by $5$ and $y^3$. You can either do these separately or together. So dividing both sides of the equation by $5y^3$ gives \n$$x^3 = \\frac{4abc^2}{5y^3} - \\frac{6z}{5w^4y^3}$$\nNow, taking the cube root of both sides gives $$x = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{4abc^2}{5y^3} - \\frac{6z}{5w^4y^3}}$$ and this is your answer.\n\n:::\n\n<!-- ## Using Factorisation -->\n\n<!-- What if the variable you want to subject is linked to more than one term? -->\n\n<!-- In this instance, we can use factorisation to help us rearrange the equation.  -->\n<!-- Let’s have a look at some examples. -->\n\n<!-- ::: {.callout-note} -->\n<!-- ## Example 9 -->\n<!-- In the equation $xy + 2x = 3y$ you can see that $x$ appears twice in the first two -->\n<!-- terms.  -->\n\n<!-- To rewrite the equation in terms of x you can factorise the right-hand side, this gives you -->\n\n<!-- $$x(y + 2) = 3y$$ -->\n\n<!-- Next, divide both side of the equation to get the final form: -->\n\n<!-- $$x = \\frac{3y}{y+2}$$ -->\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n<!-- ::: {.callout-note} -->\n<!-- ## Example 10 -->\n<!-- Here, the equation $xyz − 2z = 4y + x$ contains the variable $x$ on both sides.  -->\n\n<!-- You can start by bringing all the terms with $x$ to one side and moving the others so your equation look like this: -->\n\n<!-- $$xyz − x = 4y + 2z$$ -->\n\n<!-- Now you can factorise $x$ out the right-hand side, giving you -->\n\n<!-- $$x(yz − 1) = 4y + 2z$$ -->\n\n<!-- Finally, divide both side by $(yx − 1)$ to get -->\n\n<!-- $$x = 4y + 2z yz − 1$$ -->\n\n<!-- - Tip: If the variable you wish to subject appears more than once in an -->\n<!-- equation, it is generally a good idea to start by bringing all the terms that -->\n<!-- include the variable to one side of the equation so you can factorise it out. -->\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n<!-- ## Putting it all together -->\n\n<!-- Often expressions will include multiple operations which you will have to undo part by part to rearrange an equation.  -->\n<!-- The example below includes an expression which requires multiple steps in order to make $x$ the subject of the equation.  -->\n\n<!-- ::: {.callout-note} -->\n<!-- ## Example 11 -->\n<!-- Consider the following equation $3(x^2 + a) = \\frac{x^3}{xb} - a$ -->\n<!-- When rearranging this equation, the order of operations is important to keep in mind.  -->\n\n<!-- To rearrange the equation to make $x$ the focus, the first operation which you need to 'undo' is the bracket. -->\n\n<!--  $\\frac{3(x^2 + a)}{3} = \\frac{\\frac{x^3}{xb} - a}{3}$ -->\n\n<!--  $x^2 + a = \\frac{1}{3}(\\frac{x^3}{xb} - a)$ -->\n\n<!-- This can be simplified to  -->\n\n<!--  $x^2 + a = \\frac{1}{3}(\\frac{x^2}{b} - a)$ -->\n\n<!-- Now the $x$ on the right hand side needs to be moved to the left. This can be done by subtracting the expression in x from both sides.  -->\n<!-- This can be done as soon as any brackets have been multiplied out. -->\n\n<!--  $$x^2 + a = \\frac{x^2}{3b} - \\frac{a}{3}$$ -->\n\n<!--  $$x^2 + a -\\frac{x^2}{3b} = \\frac{x^2}{3b} - \\frac{a}{3} - \\frac{x^2}{3b}$$ -->\n\n<!--  $$x^2 + a -\\frac{x^2}{3b} = - \\frac{a}{3}$$ -->\n\n<!-- The $a$ term on the left hand side can be moved to the right hand side using subtraction again. -->\n\n<!--  $$x^2 + a -\\frac{x^2}{3b} - a = - \\frac{a}{3} - a$$ -->\n\n<!--  $$x^2 -\\frac{x^2}{3b}= - \\frac{a}{3} - a$$ -->\n\n<!--  $$x^2 (1 - \\frac{1}{3b}) = -a(1 + \\frac{1}{3})$$ -->\n\n<!--  $$x^2 (1 - \\frac{1}{3b}) = -a(1 + \\frac{1}{3})$$ -->\n\n<!--  $$x^2 = \\frac{-a(1 + \\frac{1}{3})}{1 - \\frac{1}{3b}}$$ -->\n\n<!--  $$x = ±\\sqrt{\\frac{-a(1 + \\frac{1}{3})}{1 - \\frac{1}{3b}}}$$ -->\n\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n\n\n## Quick check problems {-}\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n::: {.webex-check .webex-box}\n\n1.
