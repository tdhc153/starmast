This can be a useful skill, especially when considering the uses trigonometry has in describing motion.\ndraft: true\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Before reading this, it is strongly recommended that you read [Guide: Laws of indices](lawsofindices.qmd) [Guide: Introduction to logarithms](logarithms.qmd).* \n\nIn [Guide: Introduction to logarithms](logarithms.qmd), you learned about the different ways that you can manipulate expressions involving logarithms, such as $\\log_2(15)$ and $\\ln(x^3)$. In a more general setting however, this knowledge may not be enough; you will need to apply the ideas of logarithms to help you solve equations. \n\nSolving equations involving logarithms is a key skill in areas whenever logarithmic concepts play a role: economics, physics (particularly acoustics, where the decibel is a logarithmic measure), chemistry (pH is a logarithmic measure), biology, mathematics and statistics, computational complexity, and even music theory!\n\nBefore you dive in to solving logarithms, it is worth restating the recommendation above:\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n\n**This guide assumes an excellent knowledge of logarithms and the laws of logarithms. Please make sure that you have read [Guide: Introduction to logarithms](logarithms.qmd) before continuing.** \n\nThe numbering of the laws will follow the numbering in this guide and on [Factsheet: Laws of logarithms](../factsheets/f-lawsoflogs.qmd).\n\n:::\n\n# Discussion of techniques\n\nIn general, the first golden rule of solving equations involving logarithms is the following:\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\n## First golden rule\n\n**Make sure all logarithms are in the same base before simplifying**. To do this (if applicable) you could use the **change of base rule**.\n\nThis is because Laws 1 and 2 of the laws of logarithms can only be applied when the logarithms have the same base. \n\n:::\n\nIt may be that you have logarithms in different bases in your equation; so how can you make them to be in the same base? The answer is the **change of base** rule (Law 6), which you can use in this scenario.\n\nYou have seen in [Guide: Introduction to logarithms](logarithms.qmd) that **logarithms undo exponentiation and exponentiation undoes logarithms**. More formally, you have that for all $a > 0$ with $a \\neq 1$ and all real numbers $y$ (where the expression is defined): \n\n$$\\quad a^{\\log_a(y)} = y\\qquad \\textsf{ and }\\qquad \\log_a (a^y) = y$$\nHowever, this only works if there is one term on each side of the equation. For instance, you can notice that $$\\log_a(x) + \\log_a(y) = \\log_a(z)$$ does **not** automatically imply that $x + y = z$. This is because Law 1 of the laws of logarithms, it actually follows that $$\\log_a(x) + \\log_a(y) = \\log_a(xy) = \\log_a(z)$$ and so it actually implies that $xy = z$. \n\nSo the second golden rule of solving equations involving logarithms is the following:\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\n## Second golden rule\n\n**To undo a logarithm, you need exactly one term on each side of the equation. If both terms are logarithms, they should be in the same base.**\n\n:::\n\nSo for instance, if you are solving an equation involving logarithms, you can isolate the variable on one side of the equation, and have a constant on the other (see [Guide: Introduction to rearranging equations](introtorearrange.qmd) for more). Perhaps it looks like $\\log_a(x) = b$. From there, you can exponentiate both sides with base $a$ to get $$a^{\\log_a(x)} = x = a^b$$ and so $x=a^b$.\n\nHowever, please be aware of the following:\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n\n**You cannot take logarithms of a negative number!**\n\n:::\n\nSo if you are solving an equation involving logarithms, you need to check if the solution is *valid* by putting any answers into your original equation. This is outlined in Examples XX and XX.\n\n<!-- --- -->\n\n\n<!-- --- -->\n\n<!-- This guide should help to get a grasp of rearranging trigonometric and logarithmic equations. This can be a very useful skill, especially when considering modelling things. For example, trigonometric equations are often used to describe signal waves and motion, whereas logarithms (or exponentials) tend to be used when describing growth and decay. -->\n\n## Examples {-}\n\nThe first two examples examine exactly where the golden\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 1\n\nSolve $\\log_{10}(5x+7)=1$ for $x$.\n\nHere, there is only one logarithm and so all logarithms are in the same base, satisfying the first golden rule from above. \n\n$10^1=5x+7$. From there, you can subtract 7 from both sides, giving $3=5x$ and then divide both sides by 5, giving $x=\\frac{3}{5}$.\n\n:::\n\nYou may also come across equations which are similar to the one above, but cleverly hidden through logarithm rules. Lets go through one of those.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 7\n\n$$\\log_{10}(4x)-\\log_{10}(3)=2$$\n\nFind x. \n\nYou start by rewriting the left hand side of the equation into one logarithm. The guide on logarithms should have a section on this. This will give you $\\log_{10}(\\frac{4x}{3})=2$. \n\nNow, you should rewrite this as an exponential to get $10^2= \\frac{4x}{3}$. To finish solving, you will divide both sides by $\\frac{4}{3}$. This gives that $x=75$.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 8\n\nHere's a little example/proof which should help to understand the next example more completely. \n\nLets have a look at an equation where a number is raised to the power of a logarithm in its own base. \n\n$$e^{\\log_e(x)}=y$$ Find y in terms of x.\n\nFirstly, label up the equation according to the note at the start of this. This gives a=e, b=y, c=$\\log_e(x)$. From there, rewrite the equation as a logarithm, $\\log_e(y)=\\log_e(x)$. This means that $y=x$. We can say this for a log function but not for, lets say, a trigonometric function, as log functions don't have repeating values. \n\nOn a wider scale, this proves that $$a^{\\log_a(b)}=b$$. Whilst e was the base used in this example, it doesn't affect the outcome. You can repeat this exercise with a base of 2 if you would like to confirm. \n\n:::\n\n\nAnother use of logarithms is in solving simultaneous equations. This takes advantage of the relationship between logarithms and exponentials.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 9\n\nSolve this set of simultaneous equations\n$$e^y=2x+1$$\n$$\\ln(3x)=y$$\nThe first step for this problem would to be to substitute $y=\\ln(3x)$ into the first equation. This gives $e^{\\ln(3x)}=2x+1$. Now, lets label: a=e, b=2x+1 and c=$\\ln(3x)$. \n\nThus, refer to our example 8 to see that $ e^{ln(3x)}=3x$, and so $3x=2x+1$. Subtracting 2x from either side gives that $x=1$. Substituting this back into our equation gives that $y=\\ln(3)$ or approximately 1.099.\n\n:::\n\nHere's another example of the relationship between logarithms and exponentials.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 10\n\nSolve $$5e^{-x}+3e^x=9$$\n\nTo start with this problem, you should multiply everything by $e^x$, giving $5+3e^{2x}=9e^x$. \n\nLets rename $e^x=y$, which should hopefully give a more familiar equation: $5+3y^2=9y$. You can rearrange and solve this quadratic using the quadratic equation. This gives y=$\\frac{9+\\sqrt{21}}{16}$ or $\\frac{9-\\sqrt{21}}{16}$. \n\n$e^x=y$ implies that $\\ln(y)=x$, so you substitute y into this equation to give your final answer. This leaves you with x=$\\ln{(\\frac{9+\\sqrt{21}}{16})}$ or $\\ln{(\\frac{9-\\sqrt{21}}{16})}$, which are (to 3sf) -0.164 and -1.29 respectively. \n\n:::\n\nA final thing you may want to consider is how to solve an equationn if you have logarithms in different bases. This will make use of the change of base formula.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Change of base formula\n\n$$\\log_a(b)=\\frac{\\log_c(b)}{\\log_c(a)}$$\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 11\n\n$$\\log_{8}(x)+\\log_2(y)=\\log_2(4y+1)$$\nRepresent y in terms of x.\n\nBegin by rewriting $\\log_{8}(x)$ in base 2, using the formula. This gives $\\log_8(x)=\\frac{\\log_2(x)}{\\log_2(8)}$. Now, you can see that $\\log_2(8)=3$, as $2^3=8$ (you can use the method in Example 6 to check this). This means that $\\log_8(x)=\\frac{1}{3}\\log_2(x)$. \n\nApplying how powers work with logarithms, and inserting back into the equation you want to solve gives $\\log_2(x^{\\frac{1}{3}})+\\log_2(y)=\\log_2(4y+1)$. To get the right hand side into one log, you can say that $\\log_2(x^{\\frac{1}{3}}y)$ due to the rules for adding logs. \n\nAs the left and right hand side are in the same base, you can then say that $x^{\\frac{1}{3}}y=4y+1$. Rearranging this gives $y= \\frac{-1}{4-x^{\\frac{1}{3}}}$.\n\n:::\n\n\n## Quick check problems {-}\n\n<!-- add facility to check answers at end rather than one at a time -->\n\n::: {.webex-check .webex-box}\n\n1.
