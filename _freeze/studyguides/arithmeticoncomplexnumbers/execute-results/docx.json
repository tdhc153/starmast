This guide covers addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on complex numbers.\ndraft: true\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Before reading this guide, it is recommended that you read [Guide: Introduction to complex numbers](introtocomplexnumbers.qmd).*\n\n\n# Introduction to arithmetic on complex numbers {-}\n\nIn [Guide: Introduction to complex numbers](introtocomplexnumbers.qmd), you learned that complex numbers help you solve equations such as $x^2 = -1$ by introducing the imaginary unit $i$. \n\nHowever, what should you do if you want to add together or divide two or more different complex numbers?\n\nArithmetic on real numbers underpins almost every aspect of life. Since the complex numbers extend the real numbers, it is natural to ask how arithmetic operations work on complex numbers. \nIt turns out that this type of arithmetic is a powerful tool used to solve a variety of problems across mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science.\nIt can be used to solve problems relating to fluid dynamics, oscillations, computer graphics, and many more!\n\nUnderstanding how to do arithmetic using complex numbers allows you to perform operations - addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division - providing a framework for studying electrical circuits, wave behaviour and even quantum mechanics.\n\nThis guide will focus on how to perform these operations: starting with addition and subtraction, moving on to multiplication, then division, and finishing with quick-check questions at the end where you can test yourself. Throughout, Argand diagrams (see [Guide: Introduction to complex numbers](introtocomplexnumbers.qmd) for further information) are used to visualize complex numbers. \n\n::: {.callout-important}\n\nThroughout the guide $z = a + bi$ and $w = c + di$ are two different complex numbers where $a,b,c,d \\in R$\n:::\n\n## Addition and subtraction\n\n\nIn [Guide: Introduction to complex numbers](introtocomplexnumbers.qmd), you learned that a complex number has both a real part and an imaginary part.\\\nWhen you want to add or subtract complex numbers you should **add/subtract the real parts** and **add/subtract the imaginary parts**.\n\n\nIf you want to calculate $z + w$ then you could use this general form:\n<!-- \\begin{align*} -->\n$$z + w = (a + bi) + (c + di)$$\n$$= a + bi + c + di$$\n<!-- \\end{align*} -->\nNow you can group together the real and imaginary parts to simplify the expression:\n<!-- \\begin{align*} -->\n$$z + w = (a + c) + (b + d)i$$ \n<!-- \\end{align*} -->\nIf you want to calculate $z - w$ then you could use this general form (very similar to the general form for addition) paying special attention to the signs:\n\\begin{align*}\nz - w &= (a + bi) - (c + di)\\\\[0.5em]\n&= a + bi - c - di\\\\[0.5em]\n&= (a - c) + (b - d)i\n\\end{align*} \n\nIt follows that $\\textsf{Re}(z \\pm w) = \\textsf{Re}(z) \\pm \\textsf{Re}(w)$ and $\\textsf{Im}(z \\pm w) = \\textsf{Im}(z) \\pm \\textsf{Im}(w)$.\n\nHere are some examples of adding and subtracting complex numbers. \n\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 1\n\nWhat is $(2 + 3i) + (5 + 7i)$?\\\n\nTo work this out you should add the real parts of the two complex numbers and then add the imaginary parts of the two complex numbers.\\\n\n$\\textsf{Re}(2 + 3i) = 2$\\\n$\\textsf{Re}(5 + 7i) = 5$\n\nSo the real part should be $2 + 5 = 7$.\\\n\n$\\textsf{Im}(2 + 3i) = 3$\\\n$\\textsf{Im}(5 + 7i) = 7$\n\nSo the imaginary part should be $3 + 7 = 10$.\\\n\nTherefore, $$(2 + 3i) + (5 + 7i) = 7 + 10i$$ \n\nYou do not need to write this working every time - once you are confident you can then write like this:  \n\\begin{align*}\n(2 + 3i) + (5 + 7i) &= 2 + 3i + 5 + 7i\\\\[0.5em]\n&= 2 + 5 + 3i + 7i \\\\[0.5em]\n&= (2 + 5) + (3 + 7)i\\\\[0.5em]\n&= 7 + 10i\n\\end{align*} \nTherefore, $$(2 + 3i) + (5 + 7i) = 7 + 10i$$\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 2\nWhat is $(10 + i) - (3 - 4i)$?\\\n\nBe very careful when dealing with different signs ($-$, $+$)!\\\nThis is where being very explicit could help - if you want to, do not be afraid to clearly identify the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers first (like in Example 1).\\\n\n$\\textsf{Re}(10 + i) = 10$\\\n$\\textsf{Re}(3 - 4i) = 3$\n\nSo the real part should be $10 - 3 = 7$ (as you are  subtracting these complex numbers).\\\n\n$\\textsf{Im}(10 + i) = 1$\\\n$\\textsf{Im}(3 - 4i) = -4$\n\nSo the imaginary part should be $1 - (-4) = 1 + 4 = 5$.\\\n\nTherefore, $$(10 + i) - (3 - 4i) = 7 + 5i$$ \n\nYou do not need to write this working if you do not want to - once you are confident you can then write like this:  \n\\begin{align*}\n(10 + i) - (3 - 4i) &= 10 + i - 3 + 4i\\\\[0.5em] \n&= 10 - 3 + i + 4i \\\\[0.5em]\n&= (10 - 3) + (1 + 4)i\\\\[0.5em]\n&= 7 + 5i\n\\end{align*} \nTherefore, $$(10 + i) - (3 - 4i) = 7 + 5i$$\n\n:::\n  \n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 3\nWhat is $(2\\sqrt5 - 3i) - (4 + i\\sqrt3)$?\n\n\\begin{align*}\n(2\\sqrt5 - 3i) - (4 + i\\sqrt3) &= 2\\sqrt5 -3i - 4 - i\\sqrt3\\\\[0.5em]\n&= 2\\sqrt5 - 4 -3i - i\\sqrt3\\\\[0.5em]\n&= (2\\sqrt5 - 4) - (3 + \\sqrt3)i\n\\end{align*} \n\nTherefore, $$(2\\sqrt5 -
