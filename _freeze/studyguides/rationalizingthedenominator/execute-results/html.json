The only irrational numbers you will see in this guide are square roots. If you want to learn more about irrational numbers, have a look at [Guide: Overview of numbers].*\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<table><tr><td style=\"vertical-align: middle\"><strong>Narration of study guide:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td><audio controls><source src=\"./Narrations/rationalizingthedenominator.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio></tr></table>\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n# What is rationalizing the denominator? {-}\n\nRationalizing the denominator is helpful for doing operations like addition or subtraction on fractions and is also useful when trying to approximate fractions.\n\nWhen you rationalize the denominator, you rewrite a fraction so that the denominator contains no square roots or other $n$th roots. This guide only focuses on rationalizing the denominator of fractions that have square roots in the denominator.\n\nFor example, in the fraction $\\dfrac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}$, the denominator contains a square root of $2$. To rationalize the denominator, you want to rewrite the fraction so that the denominator is free of square roots. After applying the techniques you will learn in this guide, the fraction will look like this: $\\dfrac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, where the numerator contains a square root, but crucially, the denominator does not.\n\n::: {#definition-1-link .callout-note}\n\n## Note\n\nWhen you rewrite fractions you can multiply the numerator and denominator by the same value $k$, where $k$ is any non-zero number. When you are doing this, you are multiplying the fraction by $\\dfrac{k}{k}$ which is the same as multiplying the fraction by $1$.\n\nYou are therefore not changing the value of the fraction, which is the key concept behind rationalizing the denominator.\n\n:::\n\n# Expressions of the form $\\frac{a}{b\\sqrt{c}}$ {-}\n\nFor fractions like $\\dfrac{a}{b\\sqrt{c}}$, where $a$ is any number, $b$ is an integer and $c$ is an integer that is not a square number, you can rationalize the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the square root in the denominator. This gives you:\n\n$$\n\\frac{a}{b\\sqrt{c}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{c}}{\\sqrt{c}} = \\frac{a\\sqrt{c}}{b(\\sqrt{c})^2}\n$$\n\nSince $(\\sqrt{c})^2 = c$ by laws of indices, it follows that:\n\n$$\n\\frac{a\\sqrt{c}}{b(\\sqrt{c})^2} = \\frac{a\\sqrt{c}}{bc}\n$$\n\nThe denominator is now rational and free of square roots. As $b$ and $c$ are integers, so is $bc$. Example 1 shows you how to rationalize the denominator of the fraction you saw in the introduction.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 1\n\nSimplify $\\dfrac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}$ by rationalizing the denominator.\n\nTo rationalize this, you can multiply both the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{2}$ , giving you:\n\n$$\n\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{(\\sqrt2)^2}\n$$\n\nSimplifying the denominator then gives you:\n\n$$\n\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{(\\sqrt2)^2} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n$$\n\n\nTherefore $\\dfrac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\dfrac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, which has a rational denominator.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 2\n\nSimplify $\\dfrac{3}{2\\sqrt{5}}$ by rationalizing the denominator.\n\nYou can multiply both the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{5}$, giving you:\n\n$$\n\\frac{3}{2\\sqrt{5}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{2(\\sqrt5)^2}\n$$\n\nSince $(\\sqrt5)^2 = 5$, it follows that:\n\n$$\n\\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{2(\\sqrt5)^2} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{10}\n$$.\n\nTherefore $\\dfrac{3}{2\\sqrt{5}} = \\dfrac{3\\sqrt{5}}{10}$, which has a rational denominator.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 3\n\nSimplify $\\dfrac{5+\\sqrt{2}}{7\\sqrt{3}}$ by rationalizing the denominator.\n\nYou can multiply both the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{3}$ , giving you:\n\n$$\n\\frac{5+\\sqrt{2}}{7\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{(5 + \\sqrt{2})\\sqrt{3}}{7(\\sqrt{3})^2}\n$$\nExpanding the brackets in the numerator and simplifying the denominator then gives you:\n\n$$\n\\frac{(5 + \\sqrt{2})\\sqrt{3}}{7(\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{3}}{7(3)}\n$$\n\nSince $\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{3} = \\sqrt{6}$ by laws of indices and $7(3) = 21$, it follows that:\n\n$$\n\\frac{5\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{3}}{7(3)} = \\dfrac{5\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{6}}{21}\n$$\n\nTherefore $\\dfrac{5+\\sqrt{2}}{7\\sqrt{3}} = \\dfrac{5\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{6}}{21}$, which has a rational denominator\n\n:::\n\n# What is a quadratic conjugate? {-}\n\nHow would you rationalize the denominator of $\\dfrac{1}{7 + 2\\sqrt{3}}$?\n\nYou could try by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\sqrt{3}$, but then you will end up with a $7\\sqrt{3}$ term in the denominator, which isn't rational. It is not possible to do this with the techniques you have seen so far. In this case, more specifically, the quadratic conjugate is needed!\n\n<!-- to rationalize the denominator of $\\dfrac{1}{7 + 2\\sqrt{3}}$ -->\n\n::: {#definition-1-link .callout-note}\n\n## Definition of a quadratic conjugate\n\nGiven an expression of the form $b + c\\sqrt{d}$, where $b$ and $c$ are integers and $d$ is an integer that is not a square number, the **quadratic conjugate** is the expression with the same terms but with the opposite sign in front of the term with a square root.\n\nThe quadratic conjugate of the expression $b + c\\sqrt{d}$ is therefore $b - c\\sqrt{d}$, and the quadratic conjugate of $b - c\\sqrt{d}$ is $b + c\\sqrt{d}$.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 4\n\nWhat is the quadratic conjugate of $7 + 2\\sqrt{3}$ ?\n\n$2\\sqrt{3}$ is the term involving the square root. Changing the sign of this term from positive to negative gives you the quadratic conjugate:\n\n$$\n7 - 2\\sqrt{3}\n$$\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 5\n\nWhat is the quadratic conjugate of $- 2 - 3\\sqrt{5}$ ?\n\n$- 3\\sqrt{5}$ is the term involving the square root. Changing the sign of this term from negative to positive gives you the quadratic conjugate:\n\n$$\n-2 + 3\\sqrt{5} = 3\\sqrt{5} - 2\n$$\n\n:::\n\nThese conjugates are useful for eliminating square roots when rationalizing denominators of a particular form. Multiplying a quadratic expression $b + c\\sqrt{d}$ by its quadratic conjugate $b - c\\sqrt{d}$ eliminates the square root and gives a rational number as an answer. Doing this gives you:\n\n$$\n(b + c\\sqrt{d})(b - c\\sqrt{d}) = b^2 - bc\\sqrt{d} + bc\\sqrt{d} - (c\\sqrt{d})^2\n$$\n\nSimplifying this then gives you\n\n$$\nb^2 - c^2d\n$$\n\nThis result is rational, free of square roots, as $b,c,d$ are all integers.\n\n# Expressions of the form $\\frac{a}{b + c\\sqrt{d}}$ {-}\n\nHere $a$ is any number, $b$ and $c$ are integers and $d$ is an integer that is not a square number. In this case, rationalizing the denominator involves multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the quadratic conjugate of ${b + c\\sqrt{d}}$, which would be $b - c\\sqrt{d}$. As you saw above, the denominator will become $b^2 - c^2d$. The entire fraction therefore becomes:\n\n$$\n\\frac{a}{b + c\\sqrt{d}} \\cdot \\frac{b - c\\sqrt{d}}{b - c\\sqrt{d}} = \\frac{a(b - c\\sqrt{d})}{b^2 - c^2d}\n$$\n\nThe denominator is now $b^2 - c^2d$ and has been successfully rationalized.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 6\n\nSimplify $\\dfrac{2}{7 + 2\\sqrt{5}}$ by rationalizing the denominator.\n\nThe quadratic conjugate of the denominator is:\n\n$$\n7 - 2\\sqrt{5}\n$$\n\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by the quadratic conjugate gives you:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2}{7 + 2\\sqrt{5}} \\cdot \\frac{7 - 2\\sqrt{5}}{7 - 2\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{2(7 - 2\\sqrt{5})}{49 - 14\\sqrt{5} + 14\\sqrt{5} - (2\\sqrt{5})^2}\n$$\nSince $(2\\sqrt{5})^2 = 4(5)$ and $-14\\sqrt{5} + 14\\sqrt{5} = 0$, it follows that:\n\n$$\n \\frac{2(7 - 2\\sqrt{5})}{49 - 14\\sqrt{5} + 14\\sqrt{5} - (2\\sqrt{5})^2} = \\frac{2(7 - 2\\sqrt{5})}{49 - 4(5)}\n$$\n\nExpanding the brackets in the numerator and further simplifying the denominator then gives you:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2(7 - 2\\sqrt{5})}{49 - 4(5)} = \\frac{14 - 4\\sqrt{5}}{29}\n$$\n\nTherefore $\\dfrac{2}{7 + 2\\sqrt{5}} = \\dfrac{14 - 4\\sqrt{5}}{29}$, which has a rational denominator. Here, the answer is in its simplest form and with a positive denominator.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 7\n\nSimplify $\\dfrac{3}{2 + 5\\sqrt{3}}$ by rationalizing the denominator.\n\nThe quadratic conjugate of the denominator is:\n\n$$\n2 - 5\\sqrt{3}\n$$\n\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by the quadratic conjugate gives you:\n\n$$\n\\dfrac{3}{2 + 5\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{2 - 5\\sqrt{3}}{2 - 5\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{3(2 - 5\\sqrt{3})}{4 - 10\\sqrt{3} + 10\\sqrt{3} - (5\\sqrt{3})^2}\n$$\nSimplifying the denominator and expanding the brackets in the numerator gives you:\n\n$$\n \\frac{3(2 - 5\\sqrt{3})}{4 - 10\\sqrt{3} + 10\\sqrt{3} - (5\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\frac{6 - 15\\sqrt{3}}{4 - 25(3)}\n$$\n\nFurther simplifying the denominator then gives you:\n\n$$\n\\frac{6 - 15\\sqrt{3}}{4 - 25(3)} = \\frac{6 - 15\\sqrt{3}}{-71}\n$$\n\nHere, the answer is in its simplest form but does not have a positive denominator. You can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $-1$ to get a positive denominator. Doing this gives you:\n\n$$\n\\frac{6 - 15\\sqrt{3}}{-71} = \\frac{15\\sqrt{3} -6}{71}\n$$\n\nTherefore $\\dfrac{3}{2 + 5\\sqrt{3}} = \\dfrac{15\\sqrt{3} -6}{71}$, which has a rational denominator. The answer is also in its simplest form and has a positive denominator.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 8\n\nSimplify $\\dfrac{2 + \\sqrt{7}}{5 - \\sqrt{3}}$ by rationalizing the denominator.\n\nThe quadratic conjugate of the denominator is:\n\n$$\n5 + \\sqrt{3}\n$$\n\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by the quadratic conjugate gives you:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2 + \\sqrt{7}}{5 - \\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{5 + \\sqrt{3}}{5 + \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{(2 + \\sqrt{7})(5 + \\sqrt{3})}{(5 - \\sqrt{3})(5 + \\sqrt{3})}\n$$\n\nExpanding the brackets in both the numerator and denominator gives you:\n\n$$\n\\frac{(2 + \\sqrt{7})(5 + \\sqrt{3})}{(5 - \\sqrt{3})(5 + \\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2(5) + 2\\sqrt{3} + 5\\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{7}(\\sqrt{3})}{25 + 5\\sqrt{3} - 5\\sqrt{3} - (\\sqrt{3})^2}\n$$\n\nSimplifying the denominator then gives you:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2(5) + 2\\sqrt{3} + 5\\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{7}(\\sqrt{3})}{25 + 5\\sqrt{3} - 5\\sqrt{3} - (\\sqrt{3})^2} = \\frac{2(5) + 2\\sqrt{3} + 5\\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{7}(\\sqrt{3})}{25 - 9}\n$$\n\nSimplifying the numerator and further simplifying the denominator then gives you:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2(5) + 2\\sqrt{3} + 5\\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{7}(\\sqrt{3})}{25 - 9} = \\frac{10 + 2\\sqrt{3} + 5\\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{21}}{16}\n$$\n\nTherefore $\\dfrac{2 + \\sqrt{7}}{5 - \\sqrt{3}} = \\dfrac{10 + 2\\sqrt{3} + 5\\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{21}}{16}$, which has a rational denominator.
