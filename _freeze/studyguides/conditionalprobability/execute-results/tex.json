It is a key concept for understanding relationships between events and making better predictions in uncertain scenarios. This guide outlines how to calculate conditional probabilities, apply the multiplication rule, test for independence, and distinguish between independent and disjoint events.\ncategories:\n  - Probability\n  - Statistics\ndraft: true\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Before reading this guide, it is highly recommended that you read [Guide: Introduction to probability].*\n\n# Introduction\n\nConditional probability is a fundamental concept in probability theory. It describes how the likelihood of an event changes when additional information becomes available. In practice, it is used to update probabilities based on the outcome of related events and is widely applied in areas such as data analysis, forecasting, and decision-making. \n\nIt also forms the basis for several key results in statistics, including the multiplication rule, the Law of Total Probability, and Bayes’ Theorem. This guide covers the definition of conditional probability, methods for calculating it, ways to test for independence, and highlights the distinction between independent and disjoint events.\n\n# Conditional probability\n\nIn everyday life, the likelihood of an event often changes as new information becomes available. For example, if you're planning to leave the house and notice dark clouds gathering, you might assume it's more likely to rain and decide to bring an umbrella. This shift in expectation can be understood using **conditional probability**.\n\n**Conditional probability** is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. It helps quantify how one event influences the likelihood of another. More formally:\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=\"true\"}\n## Definition of conditional probability\n\nIf $A$ and $B$ are events, then the **conditional probability** of $A$ occurring given that $B$ has occurred, written as $P(A \\mid B)$, is defined as:\n\n$$\nP(A \\mid B)=\\dfrac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}.\n$$\n\nwhere:\n\n*  $P(A \\cap B)$ is the probability that both $A$ and $B$ occur.\n*  $P(B)$ is the probability that $B$ occurs, regardless of whether $A$ occurs.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note} \nThe notation $P(A \\mid B)$ is read as **“the probability of $A$ given $B$”**, where the vertical bar \"$\\mid$\" means “given”.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note} \nThe notation $P(A \\cap B)$ is read as **“the probability of $A$ and $B$”**, where \"$\\cap$\" denotes the **intersection**, the set of outcomes where both events occur.\n\nFor a more detailed explanation on the set notations used here, see [Guide: Operations on Sets].\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-warning} \nConditional probability is only defined when $P(B) > 0$, meaning that the event $B$ must have a chance of occurring. Otherwise, it doesn’t make sense to ask about the probability of $A$ given $B$ if $B$ has no chance of occurring. This is also reflected in the formula for conditional probability since dividing by zero would make $P(A \\mid B)$ undefined.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 1\n\nSuppose you roll a fair six-sided die. The possible outcomes are ${1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \\textsf{or } 6}$. You are told that the number is greater than 2, so what is the probability that the number is even?\n\nKnowing that the result is greater than $2$, the possible outcomes are now ${3, 4, 5, \\textsf{and } 6}$ and among these outcomes, the even numbers are $4$ and $6$. \n\nTo calculate the conditional probability:\n\n$$ \nP(\\textsf{Even} \\mid X>2) = \\dfrac{P(\\textsf{Even} \\cap X > 2)}{P(X > 2)}.\n$$\nFirst, find the individual probabilities:\n\n* $P(\\textsf{Even and } X > 2)$ is the probability of rolling an even number above $2$, meaning either a $4$ or a $6$, so:\n\n$$\nP(\\textsf{Even} \\cap X>2) = \\dfrac{2}{6}.\n$$\n\n* $P(X > 2)$ is the probability that the roll is greater than 2, which includes the outcomes $3, 4, 5,$ and $6$, so:\n\n$$\nP(X>2) = \\dfrac{4}{6}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the formula gives:\n\n$$\nP(\\textsf{Even} \\mid X>2) = \\dfrac{2/6}{4/6} = \\dfrac{2}{4} = \\dfrac{1}{2}\n$$\nSo, given that the roll is greater than 2, the probability that it is even is $1/2$.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 2\n\nNow suppose you draw a card at random from a standard deck of 52 cards. You are told that it is a face card, that is a Jack, Queen, or King. What is the probability that the card is a King?\n\nSince you know the card is a face card, the possible outcomes are now limited to the four Jacks, four Queens, and four Kings, with one King in each suit.\n\nUsing the conditional probability formula:\n\n$$\nP(\\textsf{King} \\mid \\textsf{Face card}) = \\dfrac{P(\\textsf{King} \\cap \\textsf{Face card})}{P(\\textsf{Face card})}.\n$$\nFirst, find the individual probabilities:\n\n* $P(\\textsf{King and Face card})$ is the probability that the card is a King. Since there are $4$ Kings in the deck:\n\n$$\nP(\\textsf{King} \\cap \\textsf{Face card})= \\dfrac{4}{52}.\n$$\n\n* $P(\\textsf{Face card})$ is the probability that the card is any face card. There are $12$ face cards in total, so:\n\n$$\nP(\\textsf{Face card}) = \\dfrac{12}{52}.\n$$\n\nSubstituting these into the conditional probability formula gives:\n\n$$\nP(\\textsf{King} \\mid \\textsf{Face card}) = \\dfrac{4/52}{12/52} = \\dfrac{4}{12} = \\dfrac{1}{3}.\n$$\nSo, given that the card is a face card, the probability that it is a King is $1/3$.\n:::\n\n# Multiplication rule\n\nSometimes you want to find the probability that two events both occur. For example, suppose you draw two cards from a deck, one after the other. You might know the probability that the first card is a Queen, and you might also know the probability that the second card is a Queen given that the first card was a Queen. What if you want to find the probability that both cards are Queens?\n\nThe **multiplication rule** allows you to calculate the probability that two events both occur, using a conditional probability and the probability of one of the events. It is especially useful when you have partial information about two related events.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Multiplication rule\n\nIf $A$ and $B$ are events, then the probability that both occur, $P(A \\cap B)$, is given by:\n\n$$\nP(A \\cap B) = P(B) P(A \\mid B).\n$$\nwhere: \n\n* $P(B)$ is the probability that $B$ occurs, regardless of whether $A$ occurs.\n* $P(A \\mid B)$ is the probability that $A$ occurs given that $B$ has occurred.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nThe multiplication rule also works the other way around:\n\n$$\nP(A \\cap B) = P(A) P(B \\mid A)\n$$\n\nBoth forms are correct, so choose the one that matches the information you have.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nThe multiplication rule comes from rearranging the definition of conditional probability:\n\n$$\nP(A \\mid B) = \\dfrac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\n$$\n\nTo get $P(A \\cap B)$, multiply both sides by $P(B)$:\n\n$$\nP(A \\mid B) P(B) = \\dfrac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} P(B)\n$$\n\nThe $P(B)$ terms cancel out on the right-hand side, which gives the multiplication rule:\n\n$$\nP(A \\cap B) = P(B) P(A \\mid B)\n$$\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 3\n\nSuppose you draw two cards from a standard deck of cards, one after the other, without replacement. What is the probability that both cards drawn are queens?\n\nTo solve this, use the multiplication rule:\n$$\nP(\\textsf{First queen} \\cap \\textsf{Second queen}) = P(\\textsf{First queen}) P(\\textsf{Second queen} \\mid \\textsf{First queen}).\n$$\nFirst, calculate the probability that the first card is a queen and the probability that the second card is a queen given the first was a queen. There are $4$ queens in a deck of $52$ cards, so:\n$$\nP(\\textsf{First queen}) = \\dfrac{4}{52}.\n$$\nIf the first card was a queen, there are now $3$ queens remaining in a $51$ card deck:\n$$\nP(\\textsf{Second queen} \\mid \\textsf{First queen}) = \\dfrac{3}{51}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the multiplication rule gives:\n$$\nP(\\textsf{Two queens})=(\\dfrac{4}{52})(\\dfrac{3}{51}) = \\dfrac{12}{2652}=\\dfrac{1}{221} \\approx 0.00452.\n$$\nSo, the probability of drawing two queens without replacement is approximately $0.00452$.\n:::\n\n# Checking for independence using conditional probability\n\nConditional probability can also be used to check whether two events are **independent**. If two events $A$ and $B$ are independent, then knowing that $B$ has occurred does not change the probability of $A$ occurring. In other words:\n\n$$\nP(A \\mid B) = P(A).\n$$\nThis is equivalent to:\n\n$$\nP(A \\cap B) = P(A) P(B)\n$$\n\nIf either of these conditions do not hold, then the probability of $A$ is affected by the occurrence of $B$, which means $A$ and $B$ are **dependent** events.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nFor a more detailed explanation of independent and dependent events, see [Guide: Introduction to Probability].\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 4\n\nImagine you roll a fair six-sided die as in example 1. Let $A$ be the event that the die shows an even number, and let $B$ be the event the die shows a number greater than $4$.\n\nFirst, find:\n\n* $P(A)$, the probability the die shows an even number ($2, 4,$ or $6$):\n\n$$\nP(A) = \\dfrac{3}{6} = \\dfrac{1}{2}.\n$$\n\n* Now find $P(A \\mid B)$, the probability the number is even given that it is greater than $4$. The outcomes greater than $4$ are $5$ and $6$ and among the two, only $6$ is even. So:\n\n$$\nP(A \\mid B) = \\dfrac{1}{2}\n$$\n\nSince:\n$$\nP(A \\mid B) = \\dfrac{1}{2} = P(A)\n$$\nthe events $A$ and $B$ are independent.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 5\n\nSuppose you draw a card at random from a standard deck. Let $A$ be the event that the card is a Queen, and let $B$ be the event that the card is a face card, a Jack, Queen, or King.\n\nFirst, find the individual probabilities:\n\n* $P(A)$ is the probability the card is a Queen. As there are $4$ Queens in the deck:\n\n$$\nP(A) = \\dfrac{4}{52} = \\dfrac{1}{13}.\n$$\n\n* $P(B)$ is the probability the card is a face card. As there are $12$ face cards in total:\n\n$$\nP(B) = \\dfrac{12}{52} = \\dfrac{3}{13}.\n$$\n\n* $P(A \\cap B)$ is the probability the card is both a Queen and a face card. Since all Queens are face cards, this is equal to the probability of drawing a Queen:\n\n$$\nP(A \\cap B) = \\dfrac{4}{52} = \\dfrac{1}{13}.\n$$\n\nNow check whether the multiplication rule holds:\n$$\nP(A)P(B) = (\\dfrac{1}{13})(\\dfrac{3}{13}) = \\dfrac{3}{169}\n$$\n\nBut:\n$$\nP(A \\cap B) = \\dfrac{1}{13}\n$$\n\nAnd since:\n$$\nP(A \\cap B) = \\dfrac{1}{13} \\ne \\dfrac{3}{169} = P(A)P(B),\n$$\n\nthe events $A$ and $B$ are **dependent**.\n:::\n\n# Disjoint events\n\nWhen working with probability, it's important to understand the difference between **disjoint** events and **independent** events. These terms are often confused, but they describe fundamentally different relationships between events.\n\n* **Disjoint** events (also called **mutually exclusive** events) are events that cannot occur at the same time. If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, then:\n\n$$\nP(A \\cap B) = 0.\n$$\nFor example, flipping a coin once cannot result in both heads and tails.\n\n* **Independent** events are events where the outcome of one does not affect the probability of the other. If $A$ and $B$ are independent, then:\n\n$$\nP(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B).\n$$\n\nFor example, flipping a coin and rolling a die are independent events because the result of the coin flip does not change the probability of the die roll.\n\n| Feature| Disjoint Events| Independent Events|\n|:--------|:----|:----|\n| Can both events occur at the same time? | No | Yes |\n| Formula | $P(A \\cap B) = 0$| $P(A \\cap B) = P(A) P(B)$|\n| Relationship between events | If one happens, the other cannot | One happening does not change the probability of the other |\n\nTable 1: Table comparing the key differences between disjoint and independent events.\n\n## Quick Check Problems\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n::: {.webex-check .webex-box data-topic=\"Conditional Probability\"}\n\nIn the following questions, enter your answers as simplified fractions.\n\n1.
