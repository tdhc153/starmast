Completing the square is a useful tool in many areas of mathematics, such as geometry (particularly in the theory of conic sections), integral calculus, and solving quadratic equations. Not only is it useful in these areas, it also gives you an opportunity to practise your skills involving algebraic manipulation and factorization. \n\nThis guide will focus on completing the square for quadratic expressions of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$, both where $a = 1$ and where $a \\neq 1$. \n\n# Expressions of the form $x^2 + bx + c$ {-}\n\nThe idea is to turn a quadratic expression like $$x^2 + bx + c$$ into one that looks like $$(x+p)^2 + q$$ where $b,c,p,q$ are numbers. The best way to see how this works is via an example, which relies on expanding brackets (see [Guide: Expanding brackets] for more). \n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 1\n\nSuppose you want to complete the square of a quadratic expression like $x^2 + 4x + 9$. The aim of completing the square is to find numbers $p,q$ such that $$(x+p)^2 + q = x^2 + 4x + 9.$$ Expanding the brackets on the left-hand side of this equation gives $$x^2 + 2px + p^2 + q = x^2 + 4x + 9.$$ These two expressions are equal if and only if the coefficients match. Comparing the coefficients for the $x$ terms on both sides gives $2p = 4$ and so $p = 2$. With this knowledge, you can then compare the $9$ with the $p^2 + q$ term to get $$4 + q = 9$$ and so $q = 5$. You can then write that $x^2 + 4x + 9 = (x+2)^2 + 5$ and you have completed the square.\n\nTo check your answer, you can expand the brackets of the completed square:\n\\begin{align*}\n(x+2)^2 + 5 &= x^2 + 4x + 4 + 5\\\\[0.5em]\n&= x^2 + 4x + 9\n\\end{align*}\nwhich is the original expression.\n\n:::\n\nA pictorial representation of this process is given in @fig-1. Notice that breaking down the top and rearranging gives the bottom figure.

If $c > p^2$, then $q$ is positive; if $c < p^2$, then $q$ is negative.\n\n- This gives a method for working out the completed square of any expression of the form $x^2 + bx + c$. See below for such a method.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## Method 1 ($x^2 + bx + c$)\n\nSuppose you're given an expression like $x^2 + bx + c$ and you want to write it in the form $(x+p)^2 + q$. Here's how to complete the square:\n\n- First, write $p = b/2$. This gives you $p$.\n\n- Work out $p^2$, and solve the equation $p^2 + q = c$ for $q$. This gives you $q$. \n\nThen the expression $(x+p)^2 + q$ is equal to $x^2 + bx + c$, and you have completed the square. \n\n:::\n\nYou can use this method to complete the square in the examples that follow. \n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 2\n\nSuppose you would like to complete the square of the expression $x^2 + 12x + 20$. Here, you can identify the expression as in the form $x^2 + bx + c$ with $b = 12$ and $c = 20$. Now, you can follow the steps in Method 1. \n\n- Here, $p = b/2 = 12/2 = 6$. \n\n- Working out $p^2$ gives $6^2 = 36$. Solving $p^2 + q = c$ gives $q$, and so here $36 + q = 20$. It follows that $q = -16$.\n\nYou can then say that $(x + 6)^2 - 16 = x^2 + 12x + 20$. Expanding the brackets to check your answer gives \n\\begin{align*}\n(x+6)^2 - 16 &= x^2 + 12x + 36 - 16 = x^2 + 12x + 20.\n\\end{align*}\n\n:::\n\nYou can see in this example that $q$ may be negative. The next example demonstrates a case where $p$ is negative.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 3\n\nSuppose you would like to complete the square of the expression $y^2 - 10y + 41$. Once again, you can identify the expression as in the form $y^2 + by + c$ with $b = -10$ and $c = 41$. Now, you can follow the steps in Method 1. \n\n- Here, $p = b/2 = -10/2 = -5$. \n\n- Working out $p^2$ gives $(-5)^2 = 25$. Solving $p^2 + q = c$ gives $q$, and so here $25 + q = 41$. It follows that $q = 16$.\n\nYou can then say that $(y - 5)^2 + 16 = y^2 - 10y + 41$. Expanding the brackets to check your answer gives \n\\begin{align*}\n(y-5)^2 + 16 &= y^2 - 10y + 25 + 16 = y^2 - 10y + 41.\n\\end{align*}\n\n:::\n\nThe next example contains a case where $b$ is odd, and so $p$ will not be a whole number.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 4\n\nYou are given the quadratic expression $x^2 + 3x - 1$, and you would like to complete the square. Identifying the expression as in the form $x^2 + bx + c$ with $b = 3$ and $c = -1$,  you can follow the steps in Method 1. \n\n- Here, $p = b/2 = 3/2$.\n\n- Working out $p^2$ gives $(3/2)^2 = 9/4$. Solving $p^2 + q = c$ gives $q$, and so here $$\\frac{9}{4} + q = -1.$$ Since $-1 = -4/4$, you can work out that $q = -13/4$.\n\nYou can then say that $\\displaystyle \\left(x + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 - \\frac{13}{4}$ is the completed square of $x^2 + 3x - 1$.\n\nExpanding the brackets to check your answer gives \n\\begin{align*}\n\\left(x + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 - \\frac{13}{4} &= x^2 + 3x + \\frac{9}{4} - \\frac{13}{4}\\\\[0.5em]\n&= x^2 + 3x - \\frac{4}{4} = x^2 + 3x - 1.\n\\end{align*}\n\n:::\n\nHere's a final example of an important quadratic expression previously seen in [Guide: Using the quadratic formula](quadraticformula.qmd).\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 5\n\nYou are given the quadratic expression $m^2 - m - 1$, and you would like to complete the square. Identifying the expression as in the form $m^2 + bm + c$ with $b = -1$ and $c = -1$,  you can follow the steps in Method 1. \n\n- Here, $p = -1/2$.\n\n- Working out $p^2$ gives $(-1/2)^2 = 1/4$. Solving $p^2 + q = c$ gives $q$, and so here $$\\frac{1}{4} + q = -1.$$ Since $-1 = -4/4$, you can work out that $q = -5/4$.\n\nYou can then say that $\\displaystyle\\left(m - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 - \\frac{5}{4}$ is the completed square of $m^2 - m - 1$.\n\nExpanding the brackets to check your answer gives \n\\begin{align*}\n\\left(m - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 - \\frac{5}{4} &= m^2 - m + \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{5}{4}\\\\[0.5em]\n&= m^2 - m - \\frac{4}{4} = m^2 - m - 1.\n\\end{align*}\n\n:::\n\n# Expressions of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$ {-}\n\nUnfortunately, not every quadratic expression has the coefficient of the $x^2$ term equal to $1$. It is often the case that that $a\\neq 1$ in the quadratic expression $ax^2 + bx + c$. So how do you deal with this?\n\nThe idea is to factorize the quadratic expression, taking out the constant $a$ (which is necessarily non-zero in a quadratic expression). Doing this gives $$ax^2 + bx + c = a\\left(x^2 + \\frac{b}{a}x + \\frac{c}{a}\\right)$$ You can then notice that the term inside the brackets is of the form $x^2 + rx + s$, where $r,s$ are numbers; but you can complete the square of these kinds of expressions already!\n\nSo, to complete the square of $ax^2 + bx + c$ into a form of $a(x+p)^2 + t$, you can follow this method:\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## Method 2 ($ax^2 + bx + c$)\n\nSuppose you're given an expression like $ax^2 + bx + c$ and you want to write it in the form $a(x+p)^2 + t$. Here's how to complete the square:\n\n1. First of all, take out a factor of $a$ to get $a(x^2 + rx + s)$, where $r = b/a$ and $s = c/a$. \n\n2. Complete the square on $x^2 + rx + s$ to get $(x+p)^2 + q$. \n\n3. The expression $a((x+p)^2 + q)$ is equal to $ax^2 + bx + c$. Multiplying out the brackets shows that $a(x+p)^2 + aq = ax^2 + bx + c$.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\nThere is a way of completing the square for $ax^2 + bx + c$ in the form $(dx + e)^2 + f$. The formula is given here:\n$$ax^2 + bx + c = \\left(x\\sqrt{a} + \\frac{b}{2\\sqrt{a}}\\right)^2 + \\left(c - \\frac{b^2}{4a}\\right)$$ This works well if $a$ is a perfect square; see Example 8 for more.\n\n**Do not try and remember this formula!** It is much better to reinforce the methods given in this guide rather than input numbers into this formula. \n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 6\n\nSuppose you would like to complete the square of the expression $2x^2 + 12x + 24$. Here, you can identify the expression as in the form $ax^2 + bx + c$ with $a = 2$, $b = 12$ and $c = 24$. Now, you can follow the steps in Method 1. \n\n1. Taking out a factor of $a = 2$ gives the expression as $$2x^2 + 12x + 24 = 2(x^2 + 6x + 12)$$ You can now notice the part inside the brackets is of the form $x^2 + rx + s$ with $r = 6$ and $s = 12$.\n\n2. Now, complete the square on $x^2 + 6x + 12$. Here $p = 6/2 = 3$. Working out $p^2$ gives $3^2 = 9$. Solving $p^2 + q = s$ gives $q$, and so here $9 + q = 12$. It follows that $q = 3$.\n\n3. This means that $2x^2 + 12x + 24 = 2((x+3)^2 + 3)$ and so taking out the last term in brackets gives $$2x^2 + 12x + 24 = 2(x+3)^2 + 6$$ This is your final answer.\n\nOnce again, you can expand the brackets to check your answer: \n\\begin{align*}\n2(x+3)^2 + 6 &= 2(x^2 + 6x + 9) + 6\\\\[0.5em]\n&= 2x^2 + 12x + 18 + 6 = 2x^2 + 12x + 24\n\\end{align*}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 7\n\nSuppose you would like to complete the square of the expression $4y^2 + 12y - 4$. You can identify the expression as in the form $ay^2 + by + c$ with $a = 4$, $b = 12$ and $c = -4$.\n\n1. Taking out a factor of $a = 4$ gives the expression as $$4y^2 + 12y - 4 = 4(y^2 + 3y - 1)$$ You can now notice the part inside the brackets is of the form $y^2 + ry + s$ with $r = 3$ and $s = -1$.\n\n2. Now, complete the square on $y^2 + 3y -1$. You can notice that you have already done this in Example 4 with $x$ as the variable. So here $$y^2 + 3y - 1 = \\left(y + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 - \\frac{13}{4}.$$\n\n3. This means that $\\displaystyle 4y^2 + 12y - 4 = 4\\left(\\left(y + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 - \\frac{13}{4}\\right)$ and so taking out the last term in brackets gives $$4y^2 + 12y - 4 = 4\\left(y + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 - 4\\cdot \\frac{13}{4} = 4\\left(y + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 - 13.$$\n\nOnce again, you can expand the brackets to check your answer: \n\\begin{align*}\n4\\left(y + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 - 13 &= 4\\left(y^2 + 3y + \\frac{9}{4}\\right) - 13\\\\[0.5em]\n&= 4y^2 + 12y + 9 - 13 = 4y^2 + 12y - 4\n\\end{align*}\n\nYou can simplify this example even further. You could notice here that $a=4$ is a square number; specifically, $2\\cdot 2$. By writing $4 = 2\\cdot 2$, you can use the laws of indices (see [Guide: Laws of indices](lawsofindices.qmd)) to say that \n\\begin{align*}\n4\\left(y + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 &= 2^2\\left(y + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 = \\left(2\\left(y + \\frac{3}{2}\\right)\\right)^2 = (2y + 3)^2\n\\end{align*}\nand so $4y^2 + 12y - 4 = (2y+3)^2 - 13$. This technique is particularly useful if $a$ is the square of an integer; less useful if it is not!\n\n:::\n\nThe final example in this section deals with some slightly odder looking numbers. Although the numbers will not be as nice as the previous examples, if you follow the process carefully then uglier numbers will not matter!\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 8\n\nSuppose you would like to complete the square of the expression $3m^2 - 2m - 1$. You can identify the expression as in the form $am^2 + bm + c$ with $a = 3$, $b = -2$ and $c = -1$.\n\n1. Taking out a factor of $a = 3$ gives the expression as $$3m^2 - 2m - 1 = 3\\left(m^2 - \\frac{2}{3}m - \\frac{1}{3}\\right)$$ You can now notice the part inside the brackets is of the form $m^2 + rm + s$ with $r = -2/3$ and $s = -1/3$.\n\n2. Now, complete the square on $m^2 - \\frac{2}{3}m - \\frac{1}{3}$. Here $p = (-2/3)/2 = -1/3$. Working out $p^2$ gives $(-1/3)^2 = 1/9$. Solving $p^2 + q = s$ gives $q$, and so here $$\\frac{1}{9} + q = -\\frac{1}{3}$$ It follows that $q = -4/9$.\n\n3. This means that $\\displaystyle 3m^2 - 2m - 1 = 3\\left(\\left(m - \\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 - \\frac{4}{9}\\right)$ and so taking out the last term in brackets gives $$3m^2 - 2m - 1 = 3\\left(m - \\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 - 3\\cdot \\frac{4}{9} = 3\\left(m - \\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 - \\frac{4}{3}$$ and this is your final answer.\n\nOnce again, you can expand the brackets to check your answer: \n\\begin{align*}\n3\\left(m - \\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 - \\frac{4}{3} &= 3\\left(m^2 - \\frac{2}{3}m + \\frac{1}{9}\\right) - \\frac{4}{3}\\\\[0.5em]\n&= 3m^2 - 2m + \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{4}{3} = 3m^2 - 2m - 1\n\\end{align*}\n\n:::\n\n# Solving quadratic equations {-}\n\nYou can use what you have learned in this guide to solve quadratic equations of the form $ax^2 + bx^2 + c = 0$. To do this, write the expression $ax^2 + bx + c$ as a completed square $a(x+p)^2 + t$, which is equal to $0$. You can then rearrange the equation (see [Guide: Introduction to rearranging equations](introtorearrange.qmd) for more) for $x$ to work out the roots of the quadratic equation.\n\nYou may find that $(x+p)^2$ is equal to a negative number. You can use **imaginary numbers** to then solve the quadratic. See [Guide: Introduction to complex numbers](introtocomplexnumbers.qmd) for more.\n\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 9\n\nSuppose that you want to solve the quadratic equation $x^2 + 12x + 20 = 0$. You completed the square of $x^2 + 12x + 20$ in Example 2, getting $(x+6)^2 - 16$. So $(x+6)^2 - 16 = 0$; taking the $16$ over and removing the square - taking care to include both the positive and negative roots of $16$ - gives $$x + 6 = \\pm 4$$ Therefore $x = -6 + 4= -2$ and $x = -6 - 4 = -10$ are the two solutions of $x^2 + 12x + 20 = 0$.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 10\n\nSuppose that you want to solve the quadratic equation $y^2 - 10y + 41 = 0$. You completed the square of $y^2 - 10y + 41$ in Example 3, getting $(y - 5)^2 + 16$. So $(y - 5)^2 + 16 = 0$; taking the $16$ over gives $(y-5)^2 = -16$. Using imaginary numbers (see [Guide: Introduction to complex numbers](introtocomplexnumbers.qmd)) gives $$y-5 = \\pm 4i$$ Therefore $y = 5 + 4i$ and $y = 5 - 4i$ are the two complex solutions of $y^2 - 10y + 41 = 0$.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\nYou can complete the square on the general quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ to get the **quadratic formula**, which gives solutions to **any** quadratic equation: see [Guide: Using the quadratic formula](quadraticformula.qmd) for more, and [Proof: The quadratic formula](../proofsheets/ps-quadraticformula.qmd) for how it is done.\n\n:::\n\n# Quick check problems {-}\n\n<!-- add facility for webexercises to work on html -->\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n<!-- add facility to check answers at end rather than one at a time -->\n\n::: {.webex-check .webex-box data-topic=\"CTSQ1\"}\n\nYou are given four quadratic expressions below.
