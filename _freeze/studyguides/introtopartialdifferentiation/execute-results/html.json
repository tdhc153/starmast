It focuses on how a function changes with respect to one variable while keeping others constant. It is widely used in physics, economics, and engineering to analyse systems involving multiple changing factors, such as in heat flow or optimisation.\ncategories: \n  - Calculus\nimage: FiguresPNG/introtodifferentiation-image.png\ndraft: true\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Before reading this guide, it is recommended that you read [Guide: Introduction to differentiation and the derivative](introtodifferentiation.qmd), \\[Guide: The chain rule\\], \\[Guide: The product rule\\], \\[Guide: The quotient rule\\] and \\[Guide: Continuous and differentiable functions\\].*\n\n# What is partial differentiation? {.unnumbered}\n\nAs explained in [Guide: Introduction to differentiation and the derivative](introtodifferentiation.qmd), a derivative measures how a function changes as its input changes. For example, if you have a function $f(x)$, the derivative $f'(x)$ describes the rate at which $f$ changes with respect to $x$. $$f'(x)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\left( \\dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} \\right)$$\n\nHowever, in many real-world examples, functions depend on more than one variable. For example, weather prediction involves functions that depend on pressure, humidity and time. In economics, profit might depend on both price and production level. The process of partial differentiation is essential when you want to understand the influence of each variable separately.\n\nConsider a function $f(x,y)$ that depends on two variables $x$ and $y$. Partial differentiation allows you to study the change in $f$ by considering the change in one variable at a time. If you choose to study the change in $f$ by considering the change in $x$, you need to hold $y$ fixed. In this case, $y$ is treated as a constant as it doesn't change during this process.\n\n# Definition of the partial derivative {.unnumbered}\n\nConsider a surface (some bumpy terrain) shown in the 3D graph below. A surface $z=f(x,y)$ can be defined as a function of $x$ and $y$. This means that for any values of $x$ and $y$, the function returns a value $z$ representing the height of the surface at the point $(x,y)$.\n\nA partial derivative measures how the surface changes in a single direction while keeping the other variable constant. To understand how the surface changes with respect to $x$, fix a value of $y$, say $y=1$. The surface $z=f(x,y)$ is a function of $x$ and $y$, but when $y=1$ the surface reduces to a curve $z=f(x,1)=f(x)$ in the $xz$-plane. This shows how the height $z$ depends on $x$ alone when $y$ is fixed at $1$.\n\n::::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\nThe 3D graph illustrates the surface with a vertical plane sliding through it at a chosen value of $y=a$. The points where the plane intersects the surface form a curve (shown in yellow). You can use the slider to change the value of $a$ which will change the position of the vertical plane and the shape of the curve. The 2D graph displays this curve separately.\n\n::: {#calculator3d style=\"width: 100%; height: 410px;\"}\n:::\n\n::: {#calculator2d style=\"width: 100%; height: 200px; margin-bottom: 1rem;\"}\n:::\n\n<script>\n  const elt3d = document.getElementById('calculator3d');\n  const calculator3d = Desmos.Calculator3D(elt3d);\n  calculator3d.setMathBounds({xMin: -5, xMax: 5, yMin: -5, yMax: 5, zMin: 5, zMax: 5});\n  calculator3d.setExpression({\n  id: 'info', type: 'text', text: 'Change the slider to move the horizontal plane \\(y = a\\).\\nThe 2D graph shows the profile of the surface along this plane, represented by the yellow curve in the 3D graph.', secret: false});\n  calculator3d.setExpression({id: 'surface', latex: 'z=0.3\\\\sin(x)\\\\cos(y)+0.2\\\\sin(2x+y)+0.1\\\\cos(x-2y)+1', color: '#3F68B6', secret: true});\n  calculator3d.setExpression({id: 'trace', latex: 'z=0.3\\\\sin(x)\\\\cos(y)+0.2\\\\sin(2x+y)+0.1\\\\cos(x-2y)+1\\\\left\\\\{y=a\\\\right\\\\}', color: '#FFCB00', hidden: false, secret: true});\n  calculator3d.setExpression({id: 'plane', latex: 'y = a + 0x + 0z', color: '#DB4315', secret: true});\n  calculator3d.setExpression({id: 'a', latex: 'a=1', sliderBounds: {min: -5, max: 5, step: 0.01}, secret: false});\n\n  const elt2d = document.getElementById(\"calculator2d\");\n  const calculator2d = Desmos.GraphingCalculator(elt2d, {expressions: true, settingsMenu: false, keypad: false, zoomButtons: false, lockViewport: true, expressionsTopbar: false});\n  calculator2d.setMathBounds({ left: -5, right: 5, bottom: -1, top: 3});\n  calculator2d.setExpression({id: 'a', latex: 'a=1', secret: true});\n  calculator2d.setExpression({id: 'trace', latex: 'z = 0.3\\\\sin(x)\\\\cos(a) + 0.2\\\\sin(2x + a) + 0.1\\\\cos(x - 2a) + 1', color: '#3F68B6', hidden: false, secret: true});\n\n  let lastAValue = \"a=1\";\n\n  function syncA(fromCalc, toCalc) {\n    const aExpr = fromCalc.getExpressions().find(e => e.id === 'a');\n    if (aExpr && aExpr.latex && aExpr.latex !== lastAValue) {\n      lastAValue = aExpr.latex;\n      toCalc.setExpression({ id: 'a', latex: aExpr.latex, secret: true });\n    }\n  }\n\n  setInterval(() => {\n    syncA(calculator3d, calculator2d);\n  }, 50);\n</script>\n:::::\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"pdf\" when-format=\"docx\"}\nThe 3D graph illustrates the surface with a vertical plane slicing through it at a chosen value of $y=1$.

As you go up and down the hills and valleys, you will trace out a curve that shows how the height changes along that path. The slope of this curve at any point tells you how steeply the surface is rising or falling in that direction. This is what the partial derivative measures.\n\nAs seen in [Guide: Introduction to differentiation and the derivative](introtodifferentiation.qmd), you can approximate the gradient of this function at a point by looking at how much the function's value changes over a small step. By fixing $y$ and observing how the function changes with respect to $x$, you're treating the surface as a single-variable function. The slope of the curve at a point gives the partial derivative with respect to $x$, evaluated at that value of $y$.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Definition of the partial derivative\n\nFor a function $f(x,y)$, the **partial derivative with respect to** $x$ is denoted by $$\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\quad \\textsf{or} \\quad f_x$$\n\nIt is defined by the limit $$\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\left( \\dfrac{f(x+h,y)-f(x,y)}{h} \\right)$$\n\nThis definition is similar to that of single-variable differentiation, with the key difference that $y$ is treated as a constant during the process.\n\nSimilarly, the **partial derivative with respect to** $y$ is defined by the limit $$\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\left( \\dfrac{f(x,y+h)-f(x,y)}{h} \\right)$$\n\nWhen differentiating with respect to one variable, all other variables are held fixed (they do not change).\n:::\n\n::: callout-important\nPartial derivatives are written using a curly $\\partial$ as opposed to a straight $\\mathrm{d}$ as in single-variable differentiation.\n\nAn important distinction is that if a function depends only on $x$, then $\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}x}$ as there is no other variable to hold fixed.\n:::\n\n# Computing partial derivatives {.unnumbered}\n\nTo compute a partial derivative, start by identifying the variable you want to differentiate with respect to. For example, if you want to find the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$, treat $x$ as the variable to differentiate with respect to and hold all other variables constant.\n\nIf required, apply any rules of differentiation such as the power rule, chain rule, product rule or quotient rule. These rules from single-variable differentiation still apply to partial differentiation, but they must be applied with respect to the chosen variable only and you must treat all other variables as constants. This can involve a lot of lengthy working, so take your time, especially when combining multiple rules.\n\nFor a reminder on how to apply these techniques, please see [Guide: Introduction to differentiation and the derivative](introtodifferentiation.qmd), \\[Guide: The chain rule\\], \\[Guide: The product rule\\], and \\[Guide: The quotient rule\\].\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 1\n\nConsider the function $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$.\n\nTo find the partial derivative with respect to $x$, first differentiate $x^2$ with respect to $x$ using the power rule to get $2x$. Importantly, the term $y^2$ is a constant with respect to $x$ so its partial derivative with respect to $x$ is $0$. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} &= \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^2+y^2) \\\\[0.5em]\n&= \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^2) + \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(y^2) \\\\[0.5em]\n&= 2x + 0 \\\\[0.5em]\n&= 2x\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTo find the partial derivative with respect to $y$, first differentiate $y^2$ with respect to $y$ using the power rule to get $2y$.

Now differentiate $4xy^3$ with respect to $x$ to get $4y^3$. Once again, $y$ is treated as a constant. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} &= \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(3x^{2}y + 4xy^{3}) \\\\[0.5em]\n&= \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(3x^2y) + \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(4xy^3) \\\\[0.5em]\n&= 3y\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x^2) + 4y^3\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(x) \\\\[0.5em]\n&= 3y \\cdot 2x + 4y^3 \\cdot1 \\\\[0.5em]\n&= 6xy + 4y^3\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTo find the partial derivative with respect to $y$, first differentiate $3x^2y$ with respect to $y$ to get $3x^2$. Now differentiate $4xy^3$ with respect to $y$ to get $12xy^2$. Notice that in this case, $x$ is treated as a constant. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} &= \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(3x^{2}y + 4xy^{3}) \\\\[0.5em]\n&= \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(3x^2y) + \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(4xy^3) \\\\[0.5em]\n&= 3x^2\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(y) + 4x\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(y^3) \\\\[0.5em]\n&= 3x^2 \\cdot 1 + 4x \\cdot 3y^2 \\\\[0.5em]\n&= 3x^2 + 12xy^2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 3\n\nConsider the function $f(x,y) = x^2 (3x+y^2)^3$.\n\nStart by finding the partial derivative with respect to $x$. Notice that $f(x,y)$ is a product of the two functions $x^2$ and $(3x+y^2)^3$. You need to use the product rule to differentiate the product $x^2 (3x+y^2)^3$ with respect to $x$. Then, you need to differentiate $(3x+y^2)^3$ with respect to $x$ using the chain rule. Remember to treat $y^2$ as a constant. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} &= \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x} [ x^2 (3x+y^2)^3 ] \\\\[0.5em]\n&= x^2 \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x} [ (3x+y^2)^3 ] + (3x+y^2)^3 \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x} [ x^2 ] \\\\[0.5em]\n&= x^2 \\cdot 9(3x+y^2)^2 + (3x+y^2)^3 \\cdot 2x\\\\[0.5em]\n&= 9x^2 (3x+y^2)^2 + 2x (3x+y^2)^3\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow find the partial derivative with respect to $y$. Notice that $f(x,y)$ is a product of the two functions $x^2$ and $(3x+y^2)^3$ however only the second function is a function of $y$. Therefore, this doesn't require the product rule to differentiate as $x^2$ is treated as a constant. The second function still requires you to use the chain rule. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} &= \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial y} [ x^2 (3x+y^2)^3 ] \\\\[0.5em]\n&= x^2 \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial y} [ (3x+y^2)^3 ] \\\\[0.5em]\n&= x^2 \\cdot 6y(3x+y^2)^2 \\\\[0.5em]\n&= 6x^2y(3x+y^2)^2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n:::\n\n# Higher-order partial derivatives {.unnumbered}\n\nAs with single-variable functions, you can take partial derivatives of partial derivatives to get **second-order partial derivatives**.
