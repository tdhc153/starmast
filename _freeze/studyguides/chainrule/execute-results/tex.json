For instance, the derivative can be used to show if a function is increasing or decreasing at a point. Differentiation is commonly used in many subjects (physics, chemistry, biology, economics to name a few) to analyse behaviour of systems that change, and equations involving derivatives can be solved to explain this behaviour. \n\nIt was mentioned in that same guide that you are able to differentiate certain combinations of functions, such as the sum and difference of two functions, or scalar multiple of a single function. You need extra techniques to differentiate products, quotients, and compositions of functions; you will need the **product rule**, **quotient rule**, and **chain rule** respectively. \n\nThis guide will look at the **chain rule for differentiation** in order to find the derivative of a composition $u(v(x))$ of two functions. This guide explains the rule, where it comes from, and how the chain rule can be used.\n\nThe summary table of key derivatives from [Guide: Introduction to differentiation and the derivative](introtodifferentiation.qmd) is reproduced here for reference:\n\n| Function $f(x)$ | Derivative $f'(x)$ | Notes |\n|:-----------|:-------------------|:--------|\n| $f(x) = c$ | $f'(x) = 0$ |  |\n| $f(x) = ax + b$ | $f'(x) = a$ | |\n| $f(x) = ax^n$ | $f'(x) = anx^{n-1}$ | $n \\neq 0$ |\n| $f(x) = ae^{bx}$ | $f'(x) = abe^{bx}$ |  |\n| $f(x) = a\\sin(bx)$ | $f'(x) = ab\\cos(bx)$ |  |\n| $f(x) = a\\cos(bx)$ | $f'(x) = -ab\\sin(bx)$ |  |\n| $f(x) = a\\ln(bx)$ | $f'(x) = \\dfrac{a}{x}$ |  |\n\n# Statement of the chain rule\n\nHere is the statement of the chain rule:\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## The chain rule\n\nLet $u(x)$ and $v(x)$ be two differentiable functions. Then the **chain rule** says that\n$$\\left(u\\circ v\\right)'(x) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(u(v(x))\\right) = u'(v(x))\\cdot v'(x)$$\nthat is, the derivative of $u(x)$ composed with $v(x)$ with respect to $x$ is equal to the product of the derivative of $u$ with respect to $v$ and the derivative of $v$ with respect to $x$.\n\nThis can also be written as $$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(u(v(x))\\right) = \\frac{\\textrm{d}u}{\\textrm{d}v}\\cdot \\frac{\\textrm{d}v}{\\textrm{d}x}.$$\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n\nIt's really important to keep track of variables throughout the chain rule. \n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\nThe discovery of the chain rule is often credited to [Gottfried Leibniz (link to Mactutor biography, external site)](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Leibniz/), one of the co-founders of calculus (along with Isaac Newton); although he only used it on functions of the form $\\sqrt{a + bx + cx^2}$. The first 'modern' mention of the chain rule, over a century after Leibniz' original usage, is due to [Joseph-Louis Lagrange (link to Mactutor biography, external site)](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Lagrange/).\n\n:::\n\nUnlike the product rule (see [Guide: The product rule](productrule.qmd)), the choice of functions for the chain rule is prescribed; $u(x)$ is the function on the 'outside' and $v(x)$ is the function on the 'inside'.\n\nSometimes $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are written instead of $u(x)$ and $v(x)$ in the statement of the product rule. The reason that $u(x)$ and $v(x)$ is used here is that sometimes the function itself is called $f(x)$; and you then can't use it again!\n\nTo see why this really is the derivative of the quotient of two functions, please see [Proof sheet: Rules of differentiation.](../proofsheets/ps-rulesofdifferentiation.qmd)\n\n# Examples\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n\nAlthough the statement of the chain rule uses more than one variable, **all of your final answers should be in terms of the variable on the inside**. This means that any derivative of $f(g(x))$ must be in terms of $x$, any derivative of $u(v(t))$ must be in terms of $t$ and so on. \n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 1\n\nWhat is the derivative of $y = e^{x^3}$?\n\nIn this case, you have a composition of two functions making $y$. The idea is to write $y$ as $e^v$ where $v$ is a function of $x$. So here, the two functions are determined to be $y = e^v$ and $v(x) = x^3$. In order to use the chain rule on $y$, you could differentiate $y$ with respect to $u$ and $v$ with respect to $x$ beforehand and then substitute them into the statement of the quotient rule. Doing this gives\n\n- For $y(u) = e^u$, then $\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}u} = e^u$.\n\n- For $u(x) = x^3$, then $\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}x} = 3x^2$.\n\nPutting these into the statement of the chain rule gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\textrm{d}y}{\\textrm{d}x} &= \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}v}\\cdot \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}v}{\\mathrm{d}x} = e^u\\cdot 3x^2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nbut as mentioned, you should always leave your answer in terms of $x$. Luckily, $u = x^3$, and putting this in gives $$\\frac{\\textrm{d}y}{\\textrm{d}x} = 3x^2e^{x^3}$$ and this is your final answer.\n\n:::\n\nYou don't need to be so rigorous in your own working. Here's another example of using the chain rule.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 2\n\nWhat is the derivative of $f(x) = \\ln(x^5)$ with respect to $x$?\n\nYou can use the chain rule on $f(x)$ to differentiate with respect to $x$. You can infer that $u(v) = \\ln(v)$ and $v(x) = x^5$. Differentiating $u$ with respect to $v$ gives $u'(v(x)) = 1/v = 1/x^5$ and differentiating $v$ with respect to $x$ gives $v'(x) = 5x^4$. Putting these into the statement of the chain rule gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf'(x) &= u'(v(x))\\cdot v'(x) = \\dfrac{1}{x^5}\\cdot 5x^4 = \\dfrac{5x^4}{x^5} = \\frac{5}{x}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand this is your answer. Here, the answer has been simplified by using the laws of indices.\n\n:::\n\nHere's an example which will save you a lot of tedious bracket expanding!\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 3\n\nWhat is the derivative of $y = (x^3 + 5)^7$ with respect to $x$?\n\nPrior to the chain rule, this may have required using the binomial theorem to expand these brackets and differentiate term by term (see [Guide: Binomial theorem] for more). However, you can use the chain rule on $y$ to differentiate with respect to $x$. You can infer that $u = x^3+5$ and $y= u^7$. Differentiating $y$ with respect to $u$ gives $\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}u} = 7u^6$, and differentiating $u$ with respect to $x$ gives $\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}x} = 3x^2$. Putting these into the statement of the chain rule gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}x} &= \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}u}\\cdot \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}x} = 7u^6\\cdot 3x^2 = 21x^2(x^3 + 5)^6\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand this is your answer.\n\n:::\n\nThe moral of this story (as it is also in the discussion of the product rule; see [Guide: The product rule](productrule.qmd)) is as follows:\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n\nIf you are differentiating a function comprising of brackets to a large power, **don't expand the brackets!** This only leads to extra work - and more opportunities for mistakes. Use the chain rule instead!\n\n:::\n\nHere's an example that combines the sum rule and the chain rule.\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 4\n\nFind the derivative of $y = \\sqrt{4t^4 - 1} + (t^4 + \\sqrt[3]{t} + t^{-2})^3$.\n\nIn this case, you can see that there are two functions comprising $y$. Here, $y = f + g$ where $$f(t) = \\sqrt{2t^4 - 1} = (2t^4 - 1)^{1/2}\\quad\\textsf{ and }\\quad g(t) = (t^4 + \\sqrt{t} + t^{-2})^{3}$$ You can notice that both $f$ and $g$ are compositions of functions. So you'll need to use the chain rule on each function **separately** in order to find the derivative of $y$. Let's do these in separate work areas, so that things aren't confused.\n\n- For the derivative of $f$, you can notice that $$f(u) = \\sqrt{u} = u^{1/2}\\quad\\textsf{ and } u= 2t^4 - 1$$ Differentiating $f$ with respect to $u$ and $u$ with respect to $t$ gives $$\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}u} = (1/2)u^{-1/2} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{u}}\\quad\\textsf{ and }\\quad \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 8t^3$$ Putting this into the formula for the chain rule and simplifying gives $$\\begin{aligned}\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}u}\\cdot \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{u}}\\cdot 8t^3 = \\frac{8t^3}{2\\sqrt{2t^4 + 1}} \\end{aligned}$$ and this is the derivative of $f$ with respect to $t$.\n\n- For the derivative of $g$, you can write that $$g(v) = v^3 \\quad\\textsf{ and }\\quad v = t^4 + \\sqrt{t} + t^{-2}$$ (Notice the use of $v$ instead of $u$ here!) Differentiating $g$ with respect to $v$ and $v$ with respect to $t$ gives $$\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}g}{\\mathrm{d}v} = 3v^2 \\quad\\textsf{ and }\\quad \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}v}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 4t^3 + \\frac{t^{-1/2}}{2} -2t^{-3}$$ Putting this into the formula for the chain rule and simplifying gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}g}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= \\frac{\\mathrm{d}g}{\\mathrm{d}v}\\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v}{\\mathrm{d}t} = (3v^2)\\cdot (4t^3 + \\frac{t^{-1/2}}{2} -2t^{-3})\\\\[0.5em]\n&= \\left(12t^3 + \\frac{3t^{-1/2}}{2} - 6t^{-3}\\right)(t^4 + \\sqrt{t} + t^{-2})^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nand this is the derivative of $g$ with respect to $t$.\n\nFinally, using the sum rule, you can say that\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= \\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}g}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\\\[0.5em]\n&= \\frac{8t^3}{2\\sqrt{2t^4 + 1}} + \\left(12t^3 + \\frac{3t^{-1/2}}{2} - 6t^{-3}\\right)(t^4 + \\sqrt{x} + x^{-2})^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nand this is your final answer.\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.content-hidden when-format=\"html\"}\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 4\n\nFind the derivative of $y = \\sqrt{4t^4 - 1} + (t^4 + \\sqrt[3]{t} + t^{-2})^3$.\n\nIn this case, you can see that there are two functions comprising $y$. Here, $y = f + g$ where $$f(t) = \\sqrt{2t^4 - 1} = (2t^4 - 1)^{1/2}\\quad\\textsf{ and }\\quad g(t) = (t^4 + \\sqrt{t} + t^{-2})^{3}$$ You can notice that both $f$ and $g$ are compositions of functions. So you'll need to use the chain rule on each function **separately** in order to find the derivative of $y$. Let's do these in separate work areas, so that things aren't confused.\n\n- For the derivative of $f$, you can notice that $$f(u) = \\sqrt{u} = u^{1/2}\\quad\\textsf{ and } u= 2t^4 - 1$$ Differentiating $f$ with respect to $u$ and $u$ with respect to $t$ gives $$\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}u} = (1/2)u^{-1/2} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{u}}\\quad\\textsf{ and }\\quad \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 8t^3$$ Putting this into the formula for the chain rule and simplifying gives $$\\begin{aligned}\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}u}\\cdot \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{u}}\\cdot 8t^3 = \\frac{8t^3}{2\\sqrt{2t^4 + 1}} \\end{aligned}$$ and this is the derivative of $f$ with respect to $t$.\n\n- For the derivative of $g$, you can write that $$g(v) = v^3 \\quad\\textsf{ and }\\quad v = t^4 + \\sqrt{t} + t^{-2}$$ (Notice the use of $v$ instead of $u$ here!) Differentiating $g$ with respect to $v$ and $v$ with respect to $t$ gives $$\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}g}{\\mathrm{d}v} = 3v^2 \\quad\\textsf{ and }\\quad \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}v}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 4t^3 + \\frac{t^{-1/2}}{2} -2t^{-3}$$ \n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 4 (continued)\n\nPutting this into the formula for the chain rule and simplifying gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}g}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= \\frac{\\mathrm{d}g}{\\mathrm{d}v}\\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v}{\\mathrm{d}t} = (3v^2)\\cdot (4t^3 + \\frac{t^{-1/2}}{2} -2t^{-3})\\\\[0.5em]\n&= \\left(12t^3 + \\frac{3t^{-1/2}}{2} - 6t^{-3}\\right)(t^4 + \\sqrt{t} + t^{-2})^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nand this is the derivative of $g$ with respect to $t$.\n\nFinally, using the sum rule, you can say that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= \\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}g}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\\\[0.5em]\n&= \\frac{8t^3}{2\\sqrt{2t^4 + 1}} + \\left(12t^3 + \\frac{3t^{-1/2}}{2} - 6t^{-3}\\right)(t^4 + \\sqrt{x} + x^{-2})^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand this is your final answer.\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\nHere's another example:\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 5\n\nFind the derivative of the function $f(x) = \\cos^4(x) - \\sin^4(x)$.\n\nBoth terms of the function $\\cos^4(x)$ and $\\sin^4(x)$ require the chain rule to differentiate. As in Example 3, you will need to be careful with this and do each term separately.\n\n  - To differentiate $\\cos^4(x)$, you can recognize this as a function $g(h) = h^4$ (so $g'(h(x)) = 4h^3$) where $h(x) = \\cos(x)$ (so $h'(x) = -\\sin(x)$). Using the chain rule to differentiate this gives $$\\begin{aligned} (g(h(x))' &= g'(h(x))\\cdot h'(x)\\\\[0.5em] &= 4h^3\\cdot (-\\sin(x)) = -4\\cos^3(x)\\sin(x) \\end{aligned}$$ and so the derivative of $\\cos^4(x)$ is $-4\\cos^3(x)\\sin(x)$. \n  \n  - To differentiate $\\sin^4(x)$, you can recognize this as a function $u(v) = v^4$ (so $u'(v(x)) = 4v^3$) where $v(x) = \\sin(x)$ (so $v'(x) = \\cos(x)$). Using the chain rule to differentiate this gives $$\\begin{aligned} (u(v(x))' &= u'(v(x))\\cdot v'(x)\\\\[0.5em] &= 4v^3\\cdot (\\cos(x)) = 4\\sin^3(x)\\sin(x) \\end{aligned}$$ and so the derivative of $\\sin^4(x)$ is $4\\sin^3(x)\\cos(x)$. \n  \nTherefore, putting these together using the difference rule gives: $$f'(x) = -(4\\cos^3(x)\\sin(x) + 4\\sin^3(x)\\cos(x)$$ and this could be your final answer.\n\nHowever, a little bit of factorization and knowledge of trigonometric identities (see [Guide: Trigonometric identities (radians)](trigonometricidentities-radians.qmd)) you can trim down this answer. As $\\cos^2(x) + \\sin^2(x) = 1$ and $\\sin(2x) = 2\\cos(x)\\sin(x)$, you can write\n  \n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf'(x) &= -(4\\cos^3(x)\\sin(x) + 4\\sin^3(x)\\cos(x)\\\\[0.5em]\n&= -4\\cos(x)\\sin(x)\\left(\\cos^2(x) + \\sin^2(x)\\right)\\\\[0.5em]\n&= -4\\cos(x)\\sin(x) = -2\\sin(2x)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand this is another acceptable final answer.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\nThe trimmed answer in Example 5 is nice; you can recognize this as the derivative of $\\cos(2x)$. So was all of this necessary? The answer is no; you don't always need the chain rule to differentiate if the expression you are trying to differentiate can be written in a different way.\n\nFor instance, the function in Example 4 is $$f(x) = \\cos^4(x) - \\sin^4(x)$$ which, by the difference of two squares is equal to $$f(x) = (\\cos^2(x) + \\sin^2(x))(\\cos^2(x) - \\sin^2(x)).$$ Using trigonometric identities, you can say that $\\cos^2(x) + \\sin^2(x) = 1$ and $\\cos(2x) = \\cos^2(x)-\\sin^2(x)$, and so $f(x) = \\cos(2x)$. This can then be differentiated, with the same answer as in Example 4!\n\nIn short, it's always good to explore alternative ways of writing mathematical expressions to save you a little work. \n\n:::\n\nHere's another example which requires multiple uses of the chain rule. \n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 6\n\nFind the derivative of $y = \\sin\\left(\\ln\\left(x^{-2}\\right)\\right)$.\n\nIn this situation you can write $y$ as $y(u(x))$, where $$y(u) = \\sin(u) \\quad \\textsf{ and }\\quad u(x) = \\ln(x^{-2})$$ Differentiating $y(u)$ with respect to $u$ is something that you can do, but you can see that in order to differentiate $u(x)$ with respect to $x$, you'll need to apply the chain rule! \n\nSo, to find the derivative of $u$ with respect to $x$, you can write $$u(v) = \\ln(v) \\quad \\textsf{ and }\\quad v(x) = x^{-2}$$ Differentiating $u$ with respect to $v$ and $v$ with respect to $x$ gives\n$$\\frac{\\textrm{d}u}{\\textrm{d}v} = \\frac{1}{v} \\quad \\textsf{ and }\\quad \\frac{\\textrm{d}v}{\\textrm{d}x} = -2x^{-3}$$\nPutting this into the formula for the chain rule (and carefully using the laws of indices) gives\n$$\\frac{\\textrm{d}u}{\\textrm{d}x} = \\frac{\\textrm{d}u}{\\textrm{d}v}\\cdot\\frac{\\textrm{d}v}{\\textrm{d}x} = \\frac{1}{v}\\cdot (-2x^{-3}) = \\frac{-2x^{-3}}{x^{-2}} = -2x^{-1} = -\\frac{2}{x}$$\n\nNow, you can go back to the initial problem. Thanks to your work differentiating $u$ with respect to $x$, you can say that $$\\frac{\\textrm{d}y}{\\textrm{d}u} = \\cos(u) \\quad \\textsf{ and }\\quad \\frac{\\textrm{d}u}{\\textrm{d}x} = -\\frac{2}{x}$$ Finally, putting this into the formula for the chain rule, and remembering to give your answer only in terms of $x$, gives\n$$\\frac{\\textrm{d}y}{\\textrm{d}x} = \\frac{\\textrm{d}y}{\\textrm{d}u}\\cdot\\frac{\\textrm{d}u}{\\textrm{d}x} = \\cos(u)\\cdot\\left(-\\frac{2}{x}\\right) = \\frac{-2\\cos(\\ln(x^{-2}))}{x}$$\n\nand this is your final answer.\n\n:::\n\nSince $\\frac{\\textrm{d}u}{\\textrm{d}x} = \\frac{\\textrm{d}u}{\\textrm{d}v}\\cdot\\frac{\\textrm{d}v}{\\textrm{d}x}$, it follows that for the composition of three functions $y = u(v(x))$, the derivative is given by: $$\\frac{\\textrm{d}y}{\\textrm{d}x} = \\frac{\\textrm{d}y}{\\textrm{d}u}\\cdot\\frac{\\textrm{d}u}{\\textrm{d}v}\\cdot\\frac{\\textrm{d}v}{\\textrm{d}x}$$ In fact, you can use repeated applications of the chain rule to find the derivative of any finite number of composed functions.\n\n# Applications of the chain rule {-}\n\n## Derivatives of other common functions {-}\n\nYou can use the chain rule to work out some derivatives of some other trigonometric functions. In [Guide: Trigonometry (radians)](trigonometry-radians.qmd), you saw that $$\\tan(x) = \\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)}\\qquad \\sec(x) = \\frac{1}{\\cos(x)}\\qquad \\csc(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sin(x)}\\qquad \\cot(x) = \\frac{1}{\\tan(x)} = \\frac{\\cos(x)}{\\sin(x)}$$ are the other circular trigonometric functions. By using the chain rule, you can find the derivatives of $\\sec(x)$ and $\\csc(x)$.\n\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 7\n\nWhat is the derivative of $f(x) = \\dfrac{1}{\\cos(x)}$ with respect to $x$?\n\nYou can use the chain rule on $f(x)$ to differentiate with respect to $x$. You can infer that $u(v) = 1/v = v^{-1}$ and $v(x) = \\cos(x)$. Differentiating $u$ with respect to $v$ gives $u'(v(x)) = -v^{-2} = -1/\\cos^2(x)$ and differentiating $v$ with respect to $x$ gives $v'(x) = -\\sin(x)$. Putting these into the statement of the chain rule gives\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf'(x) &= u'(v(x))\\cdot v'(x) = \\left(-\\dfrac{1}{\\cos^2(x)}\\right)\\cdot \\left(-\\sin(x)\\right) = \\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos^2(x)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand this is your answer. You could also use the fact that $\\tan(x) = \\sin(x)/\\cos(x)$ to say that $$f'(x) = \\dfrac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos^2(x)} = \\sec(x)\\tan(x).$$\n\n:::\n\nIn a similar way, you can find the derivative of $f(x) = \\csc(x)$ to be equal to $$f'(x) = -\\csc(x)\\cot(x).$$\n\n## Other rules for differentiation {-}\n\nThe process of differentiating $\\sec(x)$ and $\\csc(x)$ can be generalized to find the derivative of the reciprocal of any function, not only $\\cos(x)$ and $\\sin(x)$. If you can use the chain rule to demonstrate a general formula for the derivative of $1/f(x)$, you can not only use this general formula to differentiate $\\sec(x)$ and $\\csc(x)$, but **any other** reciprocal function. This is a common technique amongst mathematicians; find the most general formula possible to apply to as many situations as you can. Let's take a look at the **reciprocal rule**: \n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 8 (reciprocal rule)\n\nYou can use the chain rule to prove the **reciprocal rule**, which says that if $f(x)$ is not equal to $0$ for all $x$, then $$\\left(\\frac{1}{f(x)}\\right)' = \\frac{-f(x)}{(f(x))^2}.$$\n\nThe function you are trying to differentiate is $y = 1/f(x)$, so you can use the chain rule with $y(u) = 1/u = u^{-1}$ and $u(x) = f(x)$. Differentiating $y$ with respect to $u$ gives $\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}u} = -u^{-2} = -1/u^2$, and differentiating $u$ with respect to $x$ gives $\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}x} = f'(x)$. Putting these into the chain rule gives:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\textrm{d}y}{\\textrm{d}x} &= \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}u}\\cdot \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\left(-\\frac{1}{u^2}\\right)\\cdot f'(x) = \\frac{-f'(x)}{(f(x))^2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand this is exactly the reciprocal rule.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\nYou could also use the **quotient rule** to prove the reciprocal rule is true. See [Guide: The quotient rule](quotientrule.qmd) for more.\n\n:::\n\nFor instance, you can use the reciprocal rule with $f(x) = \\sin(x)$ (so $f'(x) = \\cos(x)$) to write that $$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(\\csc(x)\\right) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sin(x)}\\right) = \\frac{-(\\cos(x))}{\\sin^2(x)} = -\\csc(x)\\cot(x).$$\n\nIn fact, you can use the chain rule to prove 'rules' for differentation of functions composed with other functions. For instance, in Example 1, you saw that the derivative of $e^{x^3}$ is equal to $3x^2e^{x^3}$. Taking $f(x) = x^3$, you can see that this is equal to the derivative $f'(x) = 3x^2$ multiplied by $e^{f(x)}$. It follows that you can use the chain rule to prove that, for any function $f(x)$: $$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(e^{f(x)}\\right) = f'(x)e^{f(x)}$$\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2, you saw that the derivative of $f(x) = \\ln(x^5)$ was $5x^4/x^5$, which is the derivative of $x^5$ divided by $x^5$. This is no coincidence; using the chain rule, you can show that for any function $f(x)$: $$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\left(\\ln(f(x))\\right) = \\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}$$\n\n## Derivatives of scaled functions {-}\n\nIn [Guide: Introduction to differentiation and the derivative](introtodifferentiation.qmd), a list of common derivatives was given, and then almost immediately expanded upon - the list is reproduced above. It was mentioned that the chain rule was used to find these expanded derivatives; but why was this the case? The answer is that is because of the $bx$ in the arguments of the function. Technically, an expression like $f(x) = a\\cos(bx)$ is the composition of two functions, $f(u) = a\\cos(u)$ and $u(x) = bx$. Since the derivative of $u = bx$ is $u' = b$, this is where the $b$ comes from in $f'(x) = -ab\\sin(bx)$.\n\nIn general, you can apply this to **any** function of $x$. Using the chain rule, you can prove that if $f$ is any differentiable function, and $a,b,c$ are real numbers with $b\\neq 0$, then $$\\frac{\\textrm{d}}{\\textrm{d}x}\\left(af(bx + c)\\right) = abf'(bx + c).$$\n\nThis then allows you to quickly work out derivatives of powers of linear expressions $bx + c$:\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 9\n\nYou can use the chain rule to show that: $$\\frac{\\textrm{d}}{\\textrm{d}x}\\left((bx+c)^n\\right) = bn(bx+c)^{n-1}.$$\n\nThe function you are trying to differentiate is $y = (bx+c)^n$, so you can use the chain rule with $y(u) = u^n$ and $u(x) = bx+c$. Differentiating $y$ with respect to $u$ gives $\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}u} = nu^{n-1}$, and differentiating $u$ with respect to $x$ gives $\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}x} = b$. Putting these into the chain rule gives:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\textrm{d}y}{\\textrm{d}x} &= \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}u}\\cdot \\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}u}{\\mathrm{d}x} = nu^{n-1}\\cdot b = bnu^{n-1} = bn(bx+c)^{n-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand this is exactly as said above. A similar method can be applied to powers of any function you know how to differentiate. \n\n:::\n\n# Quick check problems {-}\n\n<!-- add facility for webexercises to work on html -->\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n<!-- add facility to check answers at end rather than one at a time -->\n\n::: {.webex-check .webex-box data-topic=\"CHAIN1\"}\n\nUsing the chain rule, match the following six functions to their derivatives with respect to $x$.
