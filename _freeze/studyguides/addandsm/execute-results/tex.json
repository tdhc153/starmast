These components can be considered independent to each other. \n\nYou are able to add two vectors together, or multiply a vector by a scalar. To do this, you have to consider each component of the vector individually. These ideas of vector addition and scalar multiplication are key concepts in **linear mathematics**, which underpins many important concepts in applied mathematics, physics, chemistry, statistics, economics, and computer science -- linear mathematics is even used in generative AI and machine learning!\n\nThis guide introduces vector addition and scalar multiplication, for vectors in both $\\mathbf{i}$,$\\mathbf{j}$,$\\mathbf{k}$ and column notation, and explains the role of vector addition and scalar multiplication in solving equations using vectors.\n\nFollowing the lead of [Guide: Introduction to vectors](introductiontovectors.qmd) this guide solely works on vectors in **three dimensions**.\n\n# Vector addition and subtraction {-}\n\n## Definition and initial examples {-}\n\nThe addition of vectors $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ is defined by following $\\mathbf{u}$ and then $\\mathbf{v}$. More specifically, you can join the start of a vector $\\mathbf{v}$ to the end of another vector $\\mathbf{u}$, and then draw a vector $\\mathbf{u}+\\mathbf{v}$ from the start of $\\mathbf{u}$ to the end of $\\mathbf{v}$.

Examining the $\\mathbf{i}$ component of the vector $\\mathbf{u}+\\mathbf{v}$, you can notice that you first move using $\\mathbf{i}$ component of $\\mathbf{u}$ and then move by the $\\mathbf{i}$ component of $\\mathbf{v}$. It follows that the $\\mathbf{i}$ component of the vector $\\mathbf{u}+\\mathbf{v}$ is the sum of the $\\mathbf{i}$ component of $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{i}$ component of $\\mathbf{v}$. You can expand this to both the $\\mathbf{j}$ and $\\mathbf{k}$ components of $\\mathbf{u}+\\mathbf{v}$ to get the following definition. \n\n::: callout-note\n## Definition of vector addition\n\nLet $\\mathbf{a} = a_1 \\mathbf{i} + a_2 \\mathbf{j} + a_3 \\mathbf{k}$ and\n$\\mathbf{b} = b_1 \\mathbf{i} + b_2 \\mathbf{j} + b_3 \\mathbf{k}$ be two vectors.

Suppose that you are scalar multiplying the vector $\\mathbf{i}$. This is a unit vector, so has magnitude $1$. Since scalar multiplication by a scalar $\\lambda$ (pronounced 'lambda') changes the length of a vector, it follows that the vector $\\lambda\\mathbf{i}$ has magnitude $|\\lambda|$, the absolute value of $\\lambda$. \n\nSince every vector $\\mathbf{u}$ is the sum of scalar multiples of $\\mathbf{i},\\mathbf{j},\\mathbf{k}$, it follows that $\\lambda\\mathbf{u}$ is the sum of scalar multiples of $\\lambda\\mathbf{i},\\lambda\\mathbf{j},\\lambda\\mathbf{k}$. This forms the basis of the definition:\n\n<!-- You can represent scalar multiplication graphically. For different real scalars, the magnitude is multiplied by that amount. Note that if the scalar is negative, the direction of the vector is reversed. -->\n\n::: callout-note\n## Definition of scalar multiplication\n\nLet $\\mathbf{a} = a_1\\mathbf{i} + a_2\\mathbf{j} + a_3\\mathbf{k}$ be a vector and let $\\lambda$ be a real number. Then the **scalar multiple of $\\mathbf{a}$ by $\\lambda$** is given by $$\\lambda \\mathbf{a} = \\lambda a_1\\mathbf{i} + \\lambda a_2\\mathbf{j} + \\lambda a_3\\mathbf{k}.$$\n\nIn column notation, if $\\mathbf{a} = \\begin{pmatrix}a_1\\\\a_2\\\\a_3\\end{pmatrix}$, then\n$\\lambda \\mathbf{a} = \\begin{pmatrix}\\lambda a_1\\\\ \\lambda a_2\\\\ \\lambda a_3 \\end{pmatrix}.$\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 7\n\nYou are given $\\mathbf{a} = \\begin{pmatrix}3\\\\5\\\\6\\end{pmatrix}$.

If $\\mathbf{u} = \\lambda \\mathbf{v}$ for some *negative* scalar $\\lambda$, then $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ are **antiparallel** to each other.\n\nEquivalently, two vectors $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ are parallel if their correpsonding unit vectors are equal; so when $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}} = \\hat{\\mathbf{v}}$. You can say that $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ are antiparallel if $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}} = -\\hat{\\mathbf{v}}$. \n:::\n\n## Solving vector equations\n\nBy combining addition and scalar multiplication, you can form vector\nequations. It is extremely important to be able to solve vector equations. They have many applications in varied field such as geometry, mechanics, multivariable calculus and more. In addition, solving vector equations is one of the key studies of linear mathematics.\n\nOne thing to remember from [Guide: Introduction to vectors](introductiontovectors.qmd) is that vectors are only equal if and only if their components are individually equal. That is, if $\\mathbf{a} = a_1 \\mathbf{i} + a_2 \\mathbf{j} + a_3 \\mathbf{k}$ and $\\mathbf{b} = b_1 \\mathbf{i} + b_2 \\mathbf{j} + b_3 \\mathbf{k}$ are two vectors, then $$\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{b}\\quad\\textsf{ if and only if }\\quad a_1 = b_1,\\, a_2 = b_2,\\, a_3 = b_3.$$\n\nThis means that to solve vector equations, you may have to solve three equations simultaneously! This requires an excellent knowledge of solving simultaneous equations; see [Guide: Solving simultaneous equations] for more.\n\nSolving vector equations is best done when following the lead of examples; here are two.

Given that the coordinates $A = \\begin{pmatrix}2\\\\-1\\\\4\\end{pmatrix}$ and\n    $B = \\begin{pmatrix}3\\\\-3\\\\-6\\end{pmatrix}$, what is the vector $\\overrightarrow{AB}$?\n\n4.  You are given three statements below. Decide whether they are true or\n    false.\n\n(a) If $\\overrightarrow{AB} = 2\\mathbf{BC}$, the two vectors are perpendicular.\n    \n(b) If $12\\mathbf{a} - 4\\mathbf{b} = 8\\mathbf{c}$, then $2\\mathbf{c} + \\mathbf{b} = 3\\mathbf{a}$.\n\n(c) If $\\lambda \\mathbf{a} + \\mu \\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{0}$ and $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ are parallel non-zero vectors, then $\\lambda = \\mu = 0$ is the only solution to this vector equation.\n\n:::\n\n# Further reading {-}\n\n[For more questions on the subject, please go to Questions: Vector addition and\nscalar multiplication.](../questions/qs-addandsm.qmd)\n\nTo explore more about vectors, including when two vectors are perpendicular, please see [Guide: The scalar product](scalarproduct.qmd).\n\n## Version history and licensing {-}\n\nv1.0: initial version created 08/23 by Renee Knapp and Kin Wang Pang as part of a University of St Andrews STEP project.\n\n  - v1.1: edited 05/24 by tdhc. \n\n[This work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/?ref=chooser-v1)\n\n\n",
