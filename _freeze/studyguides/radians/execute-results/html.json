They are used instead of degrees in areas like calculus and trigonometry, and so becoming comfortable converting between radians and degrees is an important skill. This guide also explains how to find lengths of circular arcs and areas of circular sectors.\ncategories:\n  - Geometry\n  - Trigonometry\nimage: FiguresPNG/radians-image.png\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# What are radians? {-}\n\n**Radians**, like degrees are a way of measuring the size of angles and can often be identified by the presence of **$\\pi$.**\n\nRadians are the SI unit for angles derived from the **radius of a circle**, which makes them especially useful when working with circles. You will see this relationship more in the following section on arc length and sector area. Radians are denoted by the symbol **rad**, or sometimes by $^c$ (although this is slightly older). \n\nRadians are exclusively used to describe angles in calculus; therefore if you want to study calculus in the future it is *extremely* important to understand how to convert between degrees and radians, and be comfortable using radians more generally.\n\nThis guide will firstly describe the relationship between radians and circles. Then it will describe the relationship between radians and degrees showing how to convert between them. Lastly, it will provide a table of some useful degree to radians conversions for common angle sizes.\n\n\n# Radians and circles\n\nBefore you see the close relationship between radians and circles, it s important to understand what **arcs** and **sectors** are.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## Definition of a circular arc\n\nPick any two different points on a circle and draw a curve between them, following the circle. This curve is known as a **circular arc**, but this is usually shortened to **arc**.\n\n:::\n\n \n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\nA **circle** does not include the interior of the circle. A circle together with its interior is called a **disk**.\n\n:::\n\n \n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 1\n\n@fig-circulararc shows an example of an arc.\n\n:::\n\n![A circular arc.](./FiguresPNG/radians-fig2-2.png){width=\"100%\" fig-alt=\"A circular arc\" #fig-circulararc}\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## Definition of a circular sector\n\nPick two different points on a circle and draw two radiuses between them and the centre. The area enclosed by these two radiuses of the circle and the arc between the points is called a **circular sector**, but this is usually shortened to **sector**.\n\n:::\n\n \n\n::: {.callout-note appreance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 2\n\n@fig-circularsector is an example of a sector.\n\n:::\n\n \n\n![A circular sector.](./FiguresPNG/radians-fig3-3.png){width=\"100%\" fig-alt=\"A circular sector.\" #fig-circularsector}\n\nThese two concepts form the foundations to to precisely explain the definition of a radian.\n\nPick any two points on a circle such that the length of the arc between them is **equal to the radius of the circle** and draw radiuses from these points to the centre. The angle between these two lines at the centre is defined to be $1$ radian. A precise way to say this is:\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## Definition of a radian\n\nOne **radian** is the angle formed by the section of circle where the length of the arc $a$ is the radius $r$. See @fig-radian for a picture of this.\n\nMore generally, the angle $\\theta$ in radians is defined by $a/r$, where $a$ is the length of the arc and $r$ is the radius of the circle. \n\n:::\n\n \n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\nYou can notice that the size of the circle does not change the value of $1$ rad - it is the same in any circle.\n\n:::\n\n![A visual representation of a radian.](./FiguresPNG/radians-fig1-1.png){width=\"100%\" fig-alt=\"A radian drawn on a circle.\" #fig-radian}\n\nUsing this definition, you can find the number of radians in a full circle. The well-known equation $c = 2 \\pi r$, where $c$ is the circumference of a circle and $r$ the radius, tells you that you can fit sectors with arc length $r$ side by side into the circle $2\\pi$ times. Since each of these sectors has an angle of $1$ radians at the centre, it follows that there are $2\\pi$ radians in the whole circle.\n\n![A circle divided by sectors with arc length equal to the radius.](./FiguresPNG/radians-fig4-4.png){width=\"100%\" fig-alt=\"A circle divided by sectors with arc length equal to the radius.\" #fig-twopi}\n\n# Converting between radians and degrees {-}\n\nThe process for converting from radians to degrees and from degrees to radians are direct opposites to each other.\n\n## Converting from degrees to radians\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## Converting angles from degrees to radians\n\nStarting from an angle in degrees:\n\n1. Multiply the angle in degrees by $\\pi$\n2. Divide the result by $180$\n\nYour angle is now in radians. \n\nMore precisely, suppose you have an angle of $x$ degrees. Then your angle in radians is equal to $x\\pi/180$. In particular, one degree is equal to $\\pi/180$ radians.\n\n:::\n\n \n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n\n**Where possible, remember to simplify fractions at the very end of your working.**\n\n:::\n\n \n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 3\n\nYou are given the angle $180^\\circ$ to convert to radians.\n\n- Multiplying by $\\pi$ gives $180\\pi$\n- Dividing by 180 gives $\\pi$\n\nThis means that $180^\\circ$ is equal to $\\pi$ rad.\n\nAlternatively, you could put $x = 180$ into the formula $x\\pi/180$ to obtain $180\\pi/180 = \\pi$ as the angle in radians.\n\n:::\n\n \n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 4\n\nYou are given the angle $45^\\circ$ to convert to radians.\n\n- Multiplying by $\\pi$ gives $45\\pi$\n- Dividing by 180 gives $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$\n\nThis means that $45^\\circ$ is equal to $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ rad.\n\nAlternatively, you could put $x = 45$ into the formula $x\\pi/180$ to obtain $45\\pi/180 = \\pi/4$ as the angle in radians.\n\n:::\n\n \n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n\nYou can notice that angles in radians are typically given as fractions of $\\pi$, rather than decimal numbers. In mathematics, it is usually better to express your answer **exactly** rather than as a decimal approximation.\n\n:::\n\n## Converting from radians to degrees\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## Converting angles from radians to degrees\n\nStarting from an angle in radians:\n\n- Multiply the angle in radians by $180$\n- Divide the result by $\\pi$\n\nYour angle is now in degrees.\n\nMore precisely, suppose you have an angle of $y$ radians. Then your angle in degrees is equal to $180y/\\pi$. In particular, one radian is equal to $180/\\pi = 57.295$ degrees (to three decimal places).\n\n:::\n\n \n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 5\n\nYou are given the angle $5\\pi/4$ rad to convert to degrees.\n\n- Multiplying by $180$ gives $900\\pi/4 = 225\\pi$\n- Dividing the result by $\\pi$ gives $225$.\n\nThis means that $5\\pi/4$ rad is equal to $225^\\circ$.\n\nAlternatively, you could put $y = 5\\pi/4$ into the formula $180y/\\pi$ to obtain $900\\pi/4\\pi = 225$ as the angle in degrees.\n\n:::\n\n \n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 6\n\nYou are given the angle $\\frac{\\pi}{6}$ rad to convert to degrees\n\n- Multiplying by $180$ gives $180\\pi/6 = 30\\pi$\n- Dividing the result by $\\pi$ gives $30$.\n\nThis means that $\\frac{\\pi}{6}$ rad is equal to $30^\\circ$.\n\nAlternatively, you could put $y = \\pi/6$ into the formula $180y/\\pi$ to obtain $180\\pi/6\\pi = 30$ as the angle in degrees.\n\n:::\n\n## Useful conversions to know {-}\n\nHere is a table of useful conversions of degrees to radians that come up often:\n\n| Angle in degrees | $0$ | $30$ | $45$ | $60$ | $90$ | $120$ | $135$ | $150$ | $180$ | $270$ | $360$ |\n|:--------------:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|\n| Angle in radians | $0$ | $\\dfrac{\\pi}{6}$ | $\\dfrac{\\pi}{4}$ | $\\dfrac{\\pi}{3}$ | $\\dfrac{\\pi}{2}$ | $\\dfrac{2\\pi}{3}$ | $\\dfrac{3\\pi}{4}$ | $\\dfrac{5\\pi}{6}$ | $\\pi$  | $\\dfrac{3\\pi}{2}$ | $2\\pi$ |\n\n\n# Arc length and sector area {-}\n\nIf you have two radiuses of the circle and know the angle, in radians, between these radiuses, then you can calculate the length of the arc between these lines. \n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## Equation for arc length\n\nThe length $s$ of an arc between two points is given by $s = r \\theta$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle and $\\theta$ is the angle, in radians, between the radiuses of the two given points.\n\n:::\n\nTo see why this equation holds, convince yourself that this equality is true ($c$ is the circumference of the circle): $$\\frac{s}{c} = \\frac{\\theta}{2\\pi}.$$ If you substitute $c = 2\\pi r$ into this equality, you get $$\\frac{s}{2\\pi r} = \\frac{\\theta}{2\\pi}.$$ Finally, rearranging gives you the equation $$s = r \\theta.$$\n\nSimilar to arc length, you can get an equation in terms of radians to calculate the area of a sector.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## Equation for sector area\n\nThe area $A$ of a sector of a circle with radius $r$ and angle $\\theta$ at the centre (in radians) is given by $A = \\frac{1}{2}r^2\\theta$.\n\n:::\n\n \n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 7\n\nYou are given a circle with radius $4$. Find the length of arc and the area of the sector covering an angle of $2\\pi/3$ radians.\n\nUsing the formula for length of arc with $r = 4$ and $\\theta = 2\\pi/3$ gives $$s = 4\\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{3} = \\frac{8\\pi}{3}.$$ Similarly, using the formula for area of the sector with $r=4$ and $\\theta = 2\\pi/3$ gives $$A = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{4^2\\cdot 2\\pi}{3} = \\frac{32\\pi}{6} = \\frac{16\\pi}{3}.$$\n\n:::\n\n# Quick check problems {-}\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n<!-- add facility to check answers at end rather than one at a time -->\n\n::: {.webex-check .webex-box data-topic=\"R1\"}\n\n1.
