It involves comparing a null hypothesis, which represents the status quo, against an alternative hypothesis using sample data, a chosen significance level, and either critical values or $p$-values. This guide will focus on the general structure of a hypothesis test, critical values, how to choose which type of test to use, as well as when to reject, or not reject a hypothesis.  \ncategories:\n  - Statistics\n  - Key skills\n  - Probability\nimage: FiguresPNG/hypothesistesting-fig1-1.png\ndraft: true\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Before reading this guide, it is recommended that you read [Guide: Introduction to probability]*\n\n# What is a hypothesis test? {-}\n\n**Hypothesis testing** is one of the most important and most useful tools in statistics. They help you to use data from a sample to test whether or not it is reasonable to believe a certain statistical characteristic is true for the whole population.\n\nFor example, Cantor's confectionery shop have 50 customers on average one week. Can they say that their daily average customers has now probably increased compared to their previous average of 45 per day?\n\nMOTIVATION\n\n# Setting up a hypothesis test\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\n## Hypothesis, hypothesis test\n\nA **statistical hypothesis** (shortened to **hypothesis** in this guide) is a statement showing an idea, or something that could possibly be true, about the whole of a particular data set. \n\nA **hypothesis test** allows you to say, with a defined level of certainty, whether or not a hypothesis can be rejected. This determines whether there is enough statistical evidence to show that the original hypothesis is unlikely to be true.\n\n:::\n\nGenerally speaking, when you define hypotheses in statistics, they follow a very specific format, and refer to the *entire population* being studied.\n\n- **Null hypothesis ($H_0$):** This hypothesis represents the 'status quo' or no effect. It is always a statement of equality.\n\n- **Alternative hypothesis ($H_1$):** This is the hypothesis that you are trying to test. It is always a statement of **inequality**. \n\nDepending on the question, the alternative hypothesis $H_1$ can either be **one-tailed** or **two-tailed**:\n\n    - One-tailed means you are you are testing whether the characteristic has increased or decreased. \n    - Two-tailed means you are testing whether the tested characteristic is equal to the comparative characteristic or not.\n\nHere's some examples of hypotheses that require testing. In these examples, the Greek letter $\\mu$ (mu) is used for the **population mean**; see [Guide: Means, variance, and standard deviation] for more. \n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 1\n\nCantor's Confectionery wants to determine whether their waiting times in their corporate headquarters are longer than their target of $15$ minutes per person.\n\nYou can set up a hypothesis test to evaluate this claim.\n\n**Null hypothesis ($H_0$)**: The average waiting time is equal to the target waiting time of $15$ minutes. (Remember that the null hypothesis is always statement of equality!)\n\n**Alternative hypothesis ($H_1$)**: The average waiting time is longer than the target waiting time of $15$ minutes.\n\nSo the null hypothesis is $H_0: \\mu=15$ and the alternative hypothesis is $H_1: \\mu > 15$. This is a one-tailed alternative hypothesis.\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 2\n\n**Context**: Cantor's Confectionery wants to determine if a new sweet production method produces different average approval scores compared to their traditional method.\n\n**Null hypothesis ($H_0$)**: The mean approval score for the new method $(n)$ is equal to the mean approval score for the traditional method $(t)$ $(μ_n=μ_t)$\n\n**Alternative hypothesis ($H_1$)**: The mean approval score for the new method is not equal to the mean approval score for the traditional method, indicating a difference in performance. $(μ_n≠μ_t)$\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n\n## Example 3\n\n**Context**: The confectionery factory wants to test if the proportion $P$ of defective products produced is lower than last year's average of $2\\%$.\n\n**Null hypothesis ($H_0$)**: $P=0.02$\n\n**Alternative hypothesis ($H_1$)**: $P<0.02$\n\n:::\n\n# Test selection and statistic calculation\n\nChoosing the appropriate test is really important because they all have different inputs depending on the data you have available to you. You can use this interactive flow chart of which test statistic you would want to use in whichever situation! Once you have found the test you want to use, you can refer to their relevant guide to make sure you are doing the correct calculations.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://slides.com/ellietrace/what-would-you-like-to-test-today/embed\" width=\"576\" height=\"420\" title=\"What would you like to test today?\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n# Critical values and $p$-values\n\nYou can use two different methods to decide whether or not to reject your hypothesis.\n\n**Critical value**\n\nA **critical value** is the boundary that defines the rejection region (or critical region) based on **the significance level** $\\alpha$. \n\nYou would then use statistical tables (like $Z$ or $t$ tables) to find the critical value for the chosen test and then compare the test statistic to the critical value. It can be helpful to sketch or visualize the graph whilst doing this to make sure you are not missing any negatives and you are using the right critical region depending on if you are doing a one- or two-tailed test.\n\n\n**$p$-value**\n\nThe **$p$-value** is the probability of obtaining a test statistic as extreme as the observed and is equal to the area under the distribution curve that corresponds to the test statistic.\n\n**One-tailed test:**\nIf you have an upper-tailed test: $$H_1: μ>μ_0$$ (Where $μ_0$ is the value you are testing your sample data against), the $P$-value is the area to the right of the test statistic under the probability distribution curve.\n\nIf you have a lower-tailed test: $$H_1: μ<μ_0$$ the $P$-value is the area to the left of the test statistic under the probability distribution curve. \n\n**Two-tailed test:**\nIn the case of a two-tailed test you need to find the area in both tails. Essentially, you half the $P$-value.\n\nYou would then compare the $P$-value to $\\alpha$: If the $P$-value is less than $\\alpha$, **you reject $H_0$**. If the $P$-value is greater than or equal to $\\alpha$, **you fail to reject $H_0$**\n\n\n# Significance levels\n\nA **significance level** (often called alpha ($\\alpha$)) is the level of certainty you want to test your hypothesis with, or the line at which you would reject **$H_0$**. Most commonly, $\\alpha$ is set to $0.05$ $(5$%$)$, $0.01$ $(1$%$)$ or $0.10$ $(10$%$)$. The most common choice is $\\alpha=0.05$ (so a significance level of $5$$\\%$). **This means you are willing to accept a $5\\%$ risk of rejecting a true null hypothesis.**\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\nRejecting a true null hypothesis is known as a **Type I error**, or a false positive! For more information on these [See guide: Errors in hypothesis testing]\n\n:::\n\nThis has a different impact based on whether you are performing a one-tail or a two-tail test. As shown in the graph below, for a one-tailed test, that whole $5\\%$ rejection region will be at one end of the results. This is because you are only testing whether the characteristic is greater than or equal to our comparative characteristic. In the case of a two-tailed test, that $5\\%$ will be split across either end of the distribution to reject the $2.5\\%$ at both far left and far right of the curve. This is because you are testing whether the test characteristic is both greater than or less than the comparative characteristic. If your test statistic falls in the critical region at the far end(s) of the probability distribution *[See guide: Introduction to probability distributions](introtoprobabilitydistributions.qmd)*, that is when **you reject the null hypothesis $H_0$**.\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n![A **two-tailed probability distribution** where $\\alpha=5\\%$, the critical value is 1.96 and there is a highlighted area on both the left and right tails of the curve representing a probability area of $p=0.025$ each.

This means there is not enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis and you **fail to reject $H_0$**.\n\n\nTo complete the problem, you then must formally state your conclusion!\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\n\"I reject $H_0$ as there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the mean is greater than $50$.\"\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n\n\"I do not reject $H_0$ as there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the mean is greater than $50$.\"\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\n\nHypothesis tests are based on sample data, not on the entire population so you can never accept either hypothesis; it is always a rejection or a failure to reject. This is because you cannot definitively \"prove\" the null hypothesis to be true. \n\nIf you do not reject $H_0$, this does not mean that the null hypothesis is necessarily correct; it means that the sample data didn’t provide strong enough evidence against it.\n\nSimilarly, if you reject $H_0$, this does not mean that the null hypothesis is necessarily incorrect; it means that the sample data provided strong enough evidence for the alternative hypothesis.\n\nFor more information about this see [Guide: Errors in hypothesis testing]*\n\n:::\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\n## Example 4\n\nYour local mathematical sweet shop, Cantor's Confectionery, claims that the average weight of its popular Boole Bar is $5$ grams. You suspect that the actual average weight is less than $5$ grams, so you decide to perform a hypothesis test. You take a random sample of $30$ Boole Bars and find that the average weight of the sample is $4.5$ grams with a standard deviation of $1.5$ grams. Assume you know the population standard deviation is also known to be $1.5$ grams.\n\nYou want to test if the average weight of the Boole Bars is less than $5$ grams at a significance level of $5\\%$\n\n**State your hypotheses**\n\nYour null hypothesis is that the average weight of the bars is $5$ grams and your alternative hypothesis is the average weight of bars is less than $5$ grams. \n\n$$H_0:μ=5$$\n\n$$H_1:μ<5$$\n\n**Calculating the test statistic**\n\nIn this case you have one sample of $30$ bars and you know the population standard deviation so you would want to use a $Z-$test. If you follow the steps given in the [Guide: Introduction to $Z$-testing] you would get the following:\n\n$$z= \\frac{4.5 - 5}{\\frac{1.5}{\\sqrt{30}}}$$\nWhich results in a test statistic of $-1.826$\n\n**Find the critical value or $P-$value**\n\nSince this is a one-tailed test (lower tail), you need to find the critical value for $\\alpha=0.05$ from the $Z-$table. The critical $Z-$value for a significance level of $0.05$ in a one tailed test is $-1.645$ (negative because you are looking for evidence that the mean is less than $5$ grams).\n\nAlternatively, you can find the $P-$value associated with $Z=−1.826$. From the $Z-$table, you will find that a $Z-$score of $-1.826$ corresponds to a $P-$value of approximately $0.033925$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIf your $Z-$score is less than the critical value $-1.645$ or $P≤\\alpha$, you can reject the null hypothesis $H_0$\n\nIf neither condition is met, you fail to reject the null hypothesis.\nIn this case, the calculated $Z=-1.826$, which is less than the critical value of $-1.645$, and $P=0.033925$, which is smaller than $\\alpha=0.05$.\n\nSince $Z=−1.826$ is less than $-1.645$ and the $P-$value is smaller than $0.05$, you can reject the null hypothesis.
