## What is a quadratic equation? {-}

Equations in one variable come in all shapes and sizes. 

One of the most important types of an equation is known as a **quadratic equation**. These appear almost everywhere in mathematics, from modelling projectile motion in mechanics to describing circles, ellipses, parabolas and hyperbolas in 2D space.

## Definition of quadratic equation, root

A **quadratic equation** is an equation that can be rearranged into the form $$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$ where $x$ is a variable and $a,b,c$ are real numbers with $a \neq 0$.

Values of $x$ that satisfy the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ are known as **roots** of the equation.

:::

Here, $a\neq 0$ as if it was, then the equation would no longer be a quadratic equation!

The general shape of a quadratic equation is known as a **parabola**. A figure of two parabolas is given in @fig-1; the left hand graph is if $a > 0$, whereas the right hand graph is when $a < 0$.

It is very important to be able to identify the variable in a quadratic equation, as well as the coefficients $a,b,c$. In the course of your mathematical study, it may be that the variable of a quadratic equation is not only letters like $x,y,z$, but squares or cubes like $x^2$ and $y^3$, or even functions like $e^x$, $\cos(x)$, and $\sin(y)$.

## Example 1

You are given the quadratic equation $2x^2 + 4x - 8 = 0$. The variable of the quadratic equation is $x$, and the coefficients are $a = 2, b = 4, c = -8$.

## Example 2

Here, the equation $y^4 - 10y^2 + 25 = 0$ may look like a quartic equation, but it is actually a quadratic equation. Using the laws of indices, you can rewrite the equation as $(y^2)^2 - 10y^2 + 25 = 0$. Therefore, the variable of the quadratic equation is $y^2$, and the coefficients are $a = 1$, $b = -10$, $c = 25$.

## Example 3

You are given the equation $-e^{2x} + 4e^{x} - 5 = 0$. Using the laws of indices, you can rewrite the equation as $-(e^{x})^2 + 4e^x - 5 = 0$. The variable of the quadratic equation is $e^x$, and the coefficients are $a = -1$, $b = 4$, $c = -5$. This is not the only solution to the coefficients; you can multiply the equation through by $-1$ to get $(e^{x})^2 - 4e^x + 5 = 0$, which gives $a = 1$, $b = -4$ and $c = 5$. Both solutions are equally valid.

## Example 4

You are given the equation $t+1 = \frac{4}{t-3}$. This really is a quadratic equation! You can multiply both sides by $x - 3$ to get $$(t+1)(t+3) = 4$$ You can then expand the brackets to get $$t^2 + t + 3t + 3 = 4$$ and so $t^2 + 4t + 3 = 4$. Finally, you are able to subtract $4$ from both sides to get $t^2 + 4t - 1 = 0$. It follows that the variable of the quadratic equation is $t$, and the coefficients are $a = 1$, $b = 4$, $c = -1$.

## Solving a quadratic equation

To solve the quadratic equation, you could use one of three methods:

- You could **factorise** the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ into linear equations $(mx + n)(px + q)$, then work out the roots when each of these linear equations is zero. See (Guide: Factorisation) for more. 

- You could **complete the square** in order to reduce the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ into the form $(x + b/2a)^2 = d$, and then solve from there (not forgetting the negative root). See (Guide: Completing the square) for more.

- You could **use the quadratic formula**; for a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, the two roots to the quadratic equation are given by $$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.$$

Each method is equally valid, but some may involve more work than others. It is up to you to decide which method is best for each quadratic you encounter; but it is thoroughly recommended that if you are not sure which method is best, then the quadratic formula is the one to choose. See [Guide: Using the quadratic formula](quadraticformula.qmd) for more.

## The discriminant

What the roots of the quadratic formula look like are determined by the term $b^2 - 4ac$; this term has a special name.

::: {.callout-note}

## The discriminant

The term $D = b^2 - 4ac$ is known as the **discriminant** of the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.

:::

There are then three separate cases for solutions to quadratic equations.

- If $D = b^2 - 4ac$ is positive, then $\sqrt{D}$ is a real number and the two roots of the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ are $$x = \frac{-b + \sqrt{D}}{2a}\qquad\textsf{ and }\qquad x = \frac{-b - \sqrt{D}}{2a}$$ These two roots are both real numbers and distinct from each other. You can observe this behaviour on a graph in @fig-2; the parabola crosses the $x$-axis in two places.

![A pair of parabolas. (left) A graph of a quadratic $ax^2 + bx + c$ where $a > 0$ and $D > 0$. (right) A graph of a quadratic $ax^2 + bx + c$ where $a < 0$ and $D > 0$.](./FiguresPNG/introtoquadratics-fig2-2.png){fig-alt="Two parabolas, side by side, on separate labelled axes. The parabola on the left looks like a u, and crosses the $x$-axis in precisely two places. The parabola on the right looks like a lowercase n, and crosses the $x$-axis in precisely two places. These are graphs of quadratic expressions $ax^2 + bx + c$ both with $D > 0$ and $a > 0$ and $a < 0$ respectively, and these labels appear on the image." #fig-2}
    
- If $D = b^2 - 4ac = 0$ is zero, then $\sqrt{D} = 0$. In this case, the two roots of the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ are $$x = \frac{-b}{2a} \qquad\textsf{ and }\qquad x = \frac{-b}{2a}$$ These two roots are given by the same real number. To be sure that you express both roots, you can write '$x = -b/2a$ twice'. You can observe this behaviour on a graph in @fig-3; the parabola touches the $x$-axis in exactly one place.

![A pair of parabolas. (left) A graph of a quadratic $ax^2 + bx + c$ where $a > 0$ and $D = 0$. (right) A graph of a quadratic $ax^2 + bx + c$ where $a < 0$ and $D = 0$.](./FiguresPNG/introtoquadratics-fig3-3.png){fig-alt="Two parabolas, side by side, on separate labelled axes. The parabola on the left looks like a u, and touches the $x$-axis in precisely one place. The parabola on the right looks like an n, and touches the $x$-axis in precisely one place. These are graphs of quadratic expressions $ax^2 + bx + c$ both with $D=0$ and $a > 0$ and $a < 0$ respectively, and these labels appear on the image." #fig-3}

- If $D = b^2 - 4ac$ is negative, then $\sqrt{D}$ is not a real number. In this case, the two roots of the quadratic equation are **complex numbers**. You can express the two roots of the quadratic equation by $$x = \frac{-b + i\sqrt{-D}}{2a}\qquad\textsf{ and }\qquad x = \frac{-b - i\sqrt{-D}}{2a}$$ where $i$ is the imaginary unit (so $i^2 = -1$; see (Guide: Introduction to complex numbers)). In a graph, the parabola does not cross the $x$-axis at all; this indicates that there are no real solutions to this quadratic equation. See @fig-4 for a picture.

(right) A graph of a quadratic $ax^2 + bx + c$ where $a < 0$ and $D < 0$.](./FiguresPNG/introtoquadratics-fig4-4.png){fig-alt="Two parabolas, side by side, on separate labelled axes. The parabola on the left looks like a u, and lies above the $x$-axis. The parabola on the right looks like an n, and ;ies below the $x$-axis.

::: {.callout-warning}

You can use the discriminant to check how many roots a quadratic equation has in the variable given to you. However, this is at most a maximum number of solutions. Conditions on that variable may also reduce the number of valid solutions, particularly if you have real valued functions. For instance, since $e^x > 0$ for all real number $x$, there are no solutions in $x$ if you find $e^x = -1$. 

:::

Here's some examples of using the discriminant and known properties of functions to rule out solutions.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

## Example 5

In Example 1, you identified the coefficients of $2x^2 + 4x - 8 = 0$ as $a = 2, b = 4, c = -8$. Using these, you can work out the value of the discriminant $D = b^2 - 4ac$ as $$D = (4)^2 - 4(2)(-8) = 16 + 64 = 80.$$ Since $D = 80$, you can say that this quadratic equation has two distinct real roots in $x = r_1$ and $x = r_2$.

:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

## Example 6

In Example 2, you identified the coefficients of $y^4 - 10y^2 + 25 = 0$ as $a = 1, b = -10, c = 25$, and the variable as $y^2$. Using these, you can work out the value of the discriminant $D = b^2 - 4ac$ as $$D = (-10)^2 - 4(1)(25) = 100 - 100 = 0.$$ Since $D = 0$, you can say that this quadratic equation has at most one real root $y^2 = r$. 

Whether or not the equation itself has real solutions in $y$ depends on whether $r$ is positive or negative!

:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

## Example 7

In Example 3, you identified the coefficients of $-e^{2x} + 4e^{x} - 5 = 0$ as $a = -1, b = 4, c = -5$, and the variable as $e^{x}$. Using these, you can work out the value of the discriminant $D = b^2 - 4ac$ as $$D = (4)^2 - 4(-1)(-5) = 16 - 20 = -4.$$ Since $D = -4$, you can say that this quadratic equation has complex roots. 

This equation therefore has no real solutions in $x$. This is because $e^x$ is real for any real $x$; if $e^x$ is complex, it follows that $x$ cannot be real.

:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

## Example 8

In Example 4, you rearranged the equation $t+1 = \frac{4}{t-3}$ to $t^2 + 4t - 1 = 0$, and therefore identifed the coefficients as $a = 1, b = 4, c = -1$, and the variable as $t$. Using these, you can work out the value of the discriminant $D = b^2 - 4ac$ as $$D = (4)^2 - 4(1)(-1) = 16 + 4 = 20.$$ Since $D = 20$, you can say that this quadratic equation has two distinct real roots in $t$.
