# What is a matrix? {.unnumbered}

A matrix is a rectangular array or table, with entries in rows and columns. Understanding matrices can make solving equations more efficient and can open the door to learning much more mathematics.

If you have read [Guide: Introduction to solving simultaneous equations] then one way of thinking of matrices is as an array encoding the coefficients of the variables of your simultaneous equations.

Matrices are a fundamental tool within linear algebra, and they have a wide range of real-life applications. They are used in computer graphics, data analysis, search engine optimization, cryptography, economics, robotics, genetics, quantum mechanics, and many more areas of study. Matrices are used anywhere where information needs to be analyzed and calculated efficiently. 

In this guide, you will see how you can: read, write, and understand matrices; learn how to do addition, subtraction and scalar multiplication with matrices; and be able to identify some special matrices.

## Definition of a matrix

A $m \times n$ **matrix** $A$ is a rectangular array of $mn$ many numbers (called **entries**) set out in $m$ **rows** and $n$ **columns**. You can write it like so:

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This matrix has **dimension** $m \times n$.

The notation $a_{ij}$ refers to the $ij^{th}$ entry of your matrix, that is the number in the **$i^{th}$ row and the $j^{th}$ column**. An alternative way of writing the above matrix is $A = [a_{ij}]$. 

You can specify the $ij^{th}$ entry of a particular matrix $A$ by writing $[A]_{ij} = a_{ij}$.

The entries in a matrix are usually numbers, but they can be other mathematical objects. Any type of number could be an entry in a matrix, positive or negative, rational or irrational, real or complex. (If complex numbers are unfamiliar to you, you can read more about them at [Guide: Introduction to complex numbers](introtocomplexnumbers.qmd). 

Note that while entries can be other mathematical objects, for this study guide you will exclusively use entries within the real numbers.

## Example 1

Here are some matrices:

$$
A =\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -2  \\
\pi & 5  \\
1/3 & 0 
\end{bmatrix},\quad\textsf{and}\quad B = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 2/5 & 0 & \sqrt{3} 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

As $A$ has three rows and two columns, it has dimension $3 \times 2$. The entry in the 2nd row and 1st column is called $a_{21} = [A]_{21}$, and here that is equal to $\pi$. The entry in the 1st row and 2nd column is called $a_{12} = [A]_{21}$, and here that is equal to $-2$. You can notice here that $a_{21}$ is **not equal** to $a_{12}$.

Matrix $B$ here has dimension $1 \times 4$, as it has one row and four columns. The entry in the 1st row and 2nd column is called $b_{12} = [B]_{12}$, and here that is equal to $2/5$. The entry in the 1st row and 4th column is called $b_{14} = [B]_{12}$, and here that is equal to $\sqrt{3}$.

$$
C =\begin{bmatrix}
\sqrt{2} \\
11 \\
-3/8
\end{bmatrix}, \quad\textsf{ and }\quad D=
\begin{bmatrix}
-5 & 1/2 & 0  \\
0 & -\pi & 4/9 \\
7 & 0 & -\sqrt{3} \\
-1 & 5 & 0 \\
1/4 & 0 & 8
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Matrix $C$ has dimension $3 \times 1$, as it has three rows and one column.

As $D$ has five rows and three columns, the matrix $D$ has dimension $5 \times 3$. 

:::

You can notice that $B$ only has one row; you can call such a matrix a **row matrix**. Similarly, you would call a matrix like $C$, with only one column, a **column matrix**. These are commonly known as **vectors**. You can read more about vectors in [Guide: Introduction to vectors].

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Example 2
For example the $3 \times 2$ matrix, $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1  \\1 & 1  \\1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$ could be written as $[1]_{32}$.

# Special matrices

There are special matrices 

## Zero matrix

## Identity matrix

## Diagonal matrix 

::: callout-note
## Definition of a main diagonal

For a matrix $A=[a_{ij}]_{mn}$, the entries ${a_{11},a_{22},\ldots,a_{nn}}$ make up the **main diagonal** of $A$. You can define the **main diagonal** like so:

$$\textsf{diag}A = ({a_{11},a_{22},\ldots,a_{nn}})$$
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Example 3

For the matrices in Example 1, the main diagonals are:

$\textsf{diag}A = (0,5)$

$\textsf{diag}B = (-1)$

$\textsf{diag}C = (\sqrt{2})$

$\textsf{diag}D = (-5,-\pi,-\sqrt{3})$

# Addition and subtraction with matrices {.unnumbered}

In this section, you will see when and how you can add and subtract matrices.

::: callout-important
You can only add and subtract matrices if they share the same dimensions.
:::

::: callout-note
## Definition of matrix addition and subtraction

Let $A$ and $B$ be matrices of the same dimension.
The **matrix sum of** $A$ and $B$ can be calculated by adding corresponding entries of $A$ and $B$,

$$(A + B)_{ij} = a_{ij} + b_{ij}$$

Similarly, the **matrix difference of** $A$ and $B$ can be calculated by subtracting corresponding entries of $A$ and $B$,

$$(A - B)_{ij} = a_{ij} - b_{ij}$$
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Example 4

Let $A$ and $B$ be the following two $2 \times 2$ matrices.

$$A =\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix} \quad\textsf{ and }\quad B =
\begin{bmatrix} 5 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 \end{bmatrix}$$

The sum $A + B$ is:

$$A + B = \begin{bmatrix} 1+5 & 2+6 \\ 3+7 & 4+8 \end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix} 6 & 8 \\ 10 & 12 \end{bmatrix}$$
The difference $A-B$ is:


$$A - B = \begin{bmatrix} 1-5 & 2-6 \\ 3-7 & 4-8 \end{bmatrix}= \begin{bmatrix} -4 & -4 \\ -4 & -4 \end{bmatrix}$$

:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

## Example 5

Now let $A$ and $B$ be two $3 \times 4$ matrices.

\
$$A = \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & -3 & 5 & -4 \\
3 & 0 & -2 & 2 \\
-7 & 8 & 4 & 3 
\end{bmatrix}\quad\textsf{ and }\quad B =
\begin{bmatrix} 
-1 & 4 & 3 & -2 \\
2 & -3 & 0 & 1 \\
-6 & -3 & 5 & 1/2
\end{bmatrix}$$

To subtract these matrices, you subtract the corresponding elements:

$$
A - B = \begin{bmatrix}
1 - (-1) & -3 - 4 & 5 - 3 & -4 - (-2) \\
3 - 2 & 0 - 3 & -1/2 - 0 & 2 - 1 \\
-7 - (-6) & 8 - (-3) & 4 - 5 & 3 -1/2
\end{bmatrix} 
$$
Then you can simplify the signs, 
$$
A-B= \begin{bmatrix}
1 + 1 & -3 - 4 & 5 - 3 & -4 + 2 \\
3 - 2 & 0 - 3 & -1/2 & 2 - 1 \\
-7 + 6 & 8 + 3 & 4 - 5 & 3 - 1/2
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
2 & -7 & 2 & -2 \\
1 & -3 & -1/2 & 1 \\
-1 & 11 & -1 & 5/2
\end{bmatrix}
$$
:::


You saw earlier that you can only add and subtract matrices if they share the same dimensions. You can look to this non-example to see why this is the case.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Non-example
$$A =\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & -3 \\
4/5 & 0 & 6 \end{bmatrix} \quad \textsf{(a $2 \times 3$ matrix)} \quad B =\begin{bmatrix}
-8 & 8 \\
0 & 11\end{bmatrix} \quad \textsf{(a $2 \times 2$ matrix)}$$

Why can you not add $A$ and $B$?

Matrix addition requires that each entry in one matrix corresponds to an entry in the other matrix. But, since:

- Matrix $A$ has dimensions $2 \times 3$, that is, 2 rows and 3 columns 
- Matrix $B$ has dimensions $2 \times 2$, that is, 2 rows and 2 columns 

they do **not** have the same dimensions. How you would attempt to calculate entries $(A+B)_{13}$ and $(B-A)_{23}$? 
:::

# Scalar multiplication {.unnumbered}

Sometimes you will multiply a matrix by a number or variable. This is called **scalar multiplication**.

::: callout-note
## Definition of scalar multipication with matrices

A **scalar multiplication** of a matrix $A$, by a number or variable $k$, is obtained by multiplying each entry in $A$ by $k$,

$$kA =[k \cdot a_{ij}]$$
:::

You can now see a few examples of this.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Example 6

Let’s multiply a $3 \times 2$ matrix by a scalar.

$$A =\begin{bmatrix} 
0 & 4/3 \\
-3 & \sqrt{2} \\
-7 & 12 
\end{bmatrix} \quad\quad k=3$$

To multiply this matrix by $3$, you multiply each element by $3$:

$$3A=\begin{bmatrix} 
{3 \cdot 0} & {3 \cdot 4/3} \\
{3 \cdot -3} & {3 \cdot \sqrt{2}} \\
{3 \cdot -7} & {3 \cdot 12}
\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} 
0 & 4 \\
-9 & 3\sqrt{2} \\
-21 & 36
\end{bmatrix}$$
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Example 7

Let’s multiply a $1 \times 4$ matrix by a scalar.

$$A =\begin{bmatrix} 
-6 & 7/3 & \pi & 12 \end{bmatrix} \quad\quad k=-1/2$$

To multiply this matrix by $-1/2$, you can multiply each element by $-1/2$:

$$-1/2 A=\begin{bmatrix} 
{-1/2 \cdot -6} & {-1/2 \cdot 7/3} & {-1/2 \cdot \pi} & {-1/2 \cdot 12} \end{bmatrix} =\begin{bmatrix} 
-3 & -7/6 & -\pi/2 & -6 \end{bmatrix}$$
:::

Now you can combine your understanding of matrix addition and scalar multiplication to tackle questions that combine both of these skills.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
## Example 8

Let's calculate $A + 2B$, for $$A =\begin{bmatrix} 
-2 & 3 \\
0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix} \quad\quad B =\begin{bmatrix} 
-1 & 2 \\
-1 & -3 \\
\end{bmatrix}$$

First, let's work out $2B$,
$$2 B =
\begin{bmatrix}\
2 \cdot -1 & 2 \cdot 2 \\
2 \cdot -1 & 2 \cdot -3 \end{bmatrix}$$
By carrying out these multiplications, you can arrive at,
$$2  B =
\begin{bmatrix}\
-2 & 4 \\
-2 & -6 \end{bmatrix}$$
Now $A + 2  B$,
$$A +  2B = \begin{bmatrix}
-1 + (-2) & 2 +4 \\
-1 + (-2) & -3+(-6) \\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
-3 & 6 \\
-3 & -9 \\
\end{bmatrix}$$
