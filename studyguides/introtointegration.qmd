# What is integration {-}



This guide will look at the idea of differentiation; where it comes from, how it can be used, and how you can apply its techniques to functions that you may be familiar with.

## Example 4

Determine the behaviour of the function $f(x) = 2\ln(3x) - x$ when $x = 1$. 

Here, you will first need to differentiate the function $f(x)$ to find $f'(x)$. Then, you will need to evaluate the derivative $f'(x)$ when $x = 1$ to see how the function behaves.

Using your rules of differentiation as you found above, you can say that the derivative of $2\ln(3x)$ is $2/x$, and the derivative of $x$ is $1$. Therefore, the derivative of the function $f(x) = 2\ln(3x) - x$ is $$f'(x) = \frac{2}{x} - 1.$$ You can evaluate the derivative $f'(x)$ at $x = 1$ to get $$f'(1) = \frac{2}{1} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1$$ and so the derivative is positive at $x = 1$. This implies that the function $f(x) = 2\ln(3x) - x$ is increasing at the point $x = 1$.

It also means that the gradient of the tangent to the function $f(x)$ at the point $(1,2\ln(3) - 1)$ is $1$. You can see this in the figure below.

## Summary

Here's a table of derivatives that you should remember going into any further reading on differentiation. Here, $a,b,c,n$ are any real numbers. 

| Function $f(x)$ | Derivative $f'(x)$ | Notes |
|:-----------|:-------------------|:--------|
| $f(x) = c$ | $f'(x) = 0$ |  |
| $f(x) = ax + b$ | $f'(x) = a$ | |
| $f(x) = ax^n$ | $f'(x) = anx^{n-1}$ | $n \neq 0$ |
| $f(x) = ae^{bx}$ | $f'(x) = abe^{bx}$ |  |
| $f(x) = a\sin(bx)$ | $f'(x) = ab\cos(bx)$ |  |
| $f(x) = a\cos(bx)$ | $f'(x) = -ab\sin(bx)$ |  |
| $f(x) = a\ln(bx)$ | $f'(x) = \dfrac{a}{x}$ |  |

(a) The derivative of a function at $x = a$ is equal to the gradient of the tangent to $f(x)$ at $x = a$. Answer: `r torf(TRUE)`.

(b) If $f'(a) < 0$, then the function is increasing at $x = a$. Answer: `r torf(FALSE)`.

(c) If $f(x) = c$, then the derivative $f'(x) = c-1$. Answer: `r torf(FALSE)`.

(d) The derivative of $f(x) = \cos(x)$ is $f'(x) = -\sin(x)$. Answer: `r torf(TRUE)`.
