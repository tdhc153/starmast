# What is trigonometry? {-}

Trigonometry deals with the relationship between the angles and the sides of a triangle. It can be used to calculate the heights of buildings, construct planes and even in the motion of heroes in video games. This guide will look at defining the three standard trigonometric functions (sine ($\sin$), cosine ($\cos$), tangent ($\tan$)), how to find the values of these functions from a given angle, some values to remember, and ending on the three remaining circular trigonometric functions (cosecant ($\csc$), secant ($\sec$), and cotangent ($\cot$)).

# Starting points {-}

The first introduction you may have had to the trigonometric functions is in the context of right angled triangles. If you pick an angle you want to focus on, you can then label the side opposite it with 'o', the side which has no contact with the right angle 'h' (for hypotenuse), and the final side as 'a' (as it is adjacent to the angle)- see @fig-1.

If you have some information about either two sides or a side and an angle, you can use the trigonometric functions to figure out the size of the angle or the other side.

## Definitions of trigonometric functions

The three main trigonometric functions $\sin(\theta)$, $\cos(\theta)$, and $\tan(\theta)$ are defined with respect to @fig-1 in the following way:

$$\sin(\theta) = \frac{\textsf{opposite}}{\textsf{hypotenuse}} \qquad \cos(\theta) = \frac{\textsf{adjacent}}{\textsf{hypotenuse}}\qquad  \tan(\theta) = \frac{\textsf{opposite}}{\textsf{adjacent}}$$

:::

 

:::{.callout-tip}

The abbreviation 'SOH, CAH, TOA' is often used to remember the definitions of the trigonometric functions. The first letter in each word represents the function, the second the numerator and the third the denominator. For example, SOH says that "you can find **sin** by dividing the **opposite** by the **hypotenuse**." 

:::

 

:::{.callout-note appearance="simple"}

## Example 1

You are given a triangle in @fig-0. 

![A right-angled triangle for use in Example 1.](./FiguresPNG/intrototrig-fig0-1.png){width="100%" fig-alt="Right-angled triangle with side lengths $4,7,10$, used in Example 1." #fig-0}

Find $\cos(a)$, $\sin(a)$, and $\tan(b)$.

The adjacent side to the angle $a$ has length $7$, and the hypotenuse has length $10$, so by the definition of $\cos$ you can say that $$\cos(a) = \frac{\textsf{adjacent}}{\textsf{hypotenuse}} = \frac{7}{10}.$$

The opposite side to the angle $a$ has length $4$, and the hypotenuse has length $10$, so by the definition of $\sin$ you can say that $$\sin(a) = \frac{\textsf{opposite}}{\textsf{hypotenuse}} = \frac{4}{10} = \frac{2}{5}.$$

Finally, the opposite side to the angle $b$ has length $7$, and the adjacent side has length $4$, so by the definition of $\tan$ you can say that $$\tan(b) = \frac{\textsf{opposite}}{\textsf{adjacent}} = \frac{7}{4}.$$

:::

# The unit circle {-}

The **unit circle** uses this relationship to represent the values of the trigonometric functions. The unit circle is a circle of radius one which is centered on the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system. Because of this, the radius represents the hypotenuse of the right angled triangle. Take $\theta$ to be the angle as measured **anticlockwise** from the positive $x$-axis, and suppose that $(x,y)$ is a point on the unit circle.

If $\theta$ is between $0^\circ$ and $90^\circ$, then the triangle created is right angled and the above definition for $\sin$, $\cos$, $\tan$ applies. In this case, $\cos(\theta)$ is equal to $x$ and $\sin(\theta)$ is equal to $y$. 

However, what if $\theta$ is greater than $90^\circ$? Here's an example.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

## Example 2

Say you want to represent $\sin(240^\circ)$ and $\cos(240^\circ)$ on your unit circle. You would start with an unlabelled unit circle, marking on a line $240^\circ$ from the positive $x$-axis. Now you want to make our triangle. In this case, you can draw a triangle where one side is the negative $x$-axis. Geometrically you can split the angle into the straight line and the excess which forms our triangle. That means our triangle 'starts' $180^\circ$ away from the $x$-axis. This means that the angle in our triangle will be $60^\circ$ radians. 

![Construction of triangle as in Example 1.](./FiguresPNG/intrototrigd-fig4-2.png){width="100%" fig-alt="Construction of triangle as in Example 1." #fig-4}

As you are using the unit circle, the hypotenuse will be equal to one. Then, you can label the opposite and adjacent sides as shown on the diagram above. As you know that $\sin(\theta)=\frac{\textsf{opposite}}{\textsf{hypotenuse}}$ and $\cos(\theta)=\frac{\textsf{adjacent}}{\textsf{hypotenuse}}$, you can see that the $y$-axis will represent $\sin(\theta)$ and the $x$-axis $\cos(\theta)$.

See @fig-3 for a picture of this angle on the unit circle.

<!-- As the radius/hypotenuse is of the unit circle is $1$, you can use the definitions above to see that the opposite and adjacent sides represent the absolute values of $\sin(\theta)$ and $\cos(\theta)$ respectively.  -->

So from Example 1, the value of $\sin(240^\circ)$ and $\cos(240^\circ)$ are the $y$-axis and the $x$-axis respectively. Together with the discussion before Example 1, this leads to a new definition of the two trigonometric functions $\sin$ and $\cos$:

::: {.callout-note}
 
## Definition of sin, cos, tan in terms of the unit circle

Let $(x,y)$ be a point on the unit circle centred at the origin $(0,0)$. Let $\theta$ be the angle defined by the positive $x$-axis and the line segment from centre to the point $(x,y)$. Define
$$\cos(\theta) = x \qquad \sin(\theta) = y$$
and
$$\tan(\theta) = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)}$$

:::

This definition extends the trigonometric functions to situations outside right-angled triangles; dramatically increasing their usability. The figure below details how the values of $\cos(t), \sin(t), \tan(t)$ change as the angle $t$ changes.

:::

In the unit circle, the angle $\theta$ ranges from $0^\circ$ to $360^\circ$. Over this range, the values of the co-ordinates $x$ and $y$ range from positive to negative. Therefore, the three main trigonometric functions $\sin$, $\cos$ and $\tan$ take different signs in different positions. 

(1) If $x > 0$ and $y > 0$ (so $0^\circ< \theta < 90^\circ$), then both $\cos(\theta) > 0$ and $\sin(\theta) > 0$, and therefore $\tan\theta > 0$.

(2) If $x < 0$ and $y > 0$ (so $90^\circ < \theta < 180^\circ$), then $\cos(\theta) < 0$ and $\sin(\theta) > 0$, and therefore $\tan(\theta) < 0$.

(3) If $x < 0$ and $y < 0$ (so $180^\circ < \theta < 270^\circ$), then both $\cos(\theta) < 0$ and $\sin(\theta) < 0$, and therefore $\tan(\theta) > 0$.

(4) If $x > 0$ and $y < 0$ (so $270^\circ < \theta < 360^\circ$), then $\cos(\theta) > 0$ and $\sin(\theta) < 0$, and therefore $\tan(\theta) < 0$.

See @fig-5 for a picture of this behaviour.

This analysis has missed out values of the three trigonometric functions on the axes. Here $\theta=0^\circ$ along the positive $x$-axis, $\theta=90^\circ$ along the positive $y$-axis, $\theta=180^\circ$ along the negative $x$-axis, and $\theta=270^\circ$ along the negative $y$-axis. 

- If $\theta = 0^\circ$, then $x = 1$ and $y = 0$. Therefore $\cos(0) = 1/1 = 1$ and $\sin(0) = \tfrac{0}{1} = 0$ and so $\tan(0) = \sin(0)/\cos(0) = 0/1 = 0$.

- If $\theta = 90^\circ$ (right angle of positive $x$ and $y$ axes) then $x = 0$ and $y = 1$. Therefore $\cos(90^\circ) = 0/1 = 0$ and $\sin(90^\circ) = 1/1 = 1$. In this case, $\tan(90^\circ)$ is **undefined** as $\cos(90^\circ) = 0$.

- If $\theta = 180^\circ$ (straight line, angle of positive $x$ and negative $x$ axes) then $x = -1$ and $y = 0$. Therefore $\cos(180^\circ) = -1/1 = -1$ and $\sin(180^\circ) = 0/1 = 0$. In this case, $\tan(180^\circ) = \sin(180^\circ)/\cos(180^\circ) = 0/(-1) = 0$.

- If $\theta = 270^\circ$ (right angle of positive $x$ and negative $y$ axes) then $x = 0$ and $y = -1$. Therefore $\cos \left(270^\circ\right) = 0/1 = 0$ and $\sin\left(270^\circ\right) = -1/1 = -1$. In this case, $\tan(270^\circ)$ is **undefined** as $\cos (270^\circ) = 0$.

<!-- This is done in degrees, although it may be appropriate to operate in radians, wherein it would be $0\textsf{ rad}$, $\frac{\pi}{2}\textsf{ rad}$, $\pi\textsf{ rad}$, and $\frac{3\pi}{4}\textsf{ rad}$ respectively. If you have any issues with these conversions, feel free to consult [Guide: Introduction to radians](radians.qmd). -->

<!-- You can also find $\tan(\theta)$ by using that $\tan(\theta)=\frac{sin(\theta)}{cos(\theta)}$.  -->

<!-- It is important to note that these are the absolute values which you get from reading off of this system, as they are lengths. You can figure out the sign of your functions by considering what quadrant you are looking in; this depends on your angle, and drawing out the unit circle can often help when starting out. Whilst I have spoken in terms of opposite and adjacent sides of a triangle, when using the unit circle it turns out that the magnitude of $\cos(\theta)$ will always be the x coordinate and the magnitude of $\sin(\theta)$ always the y coordinate. This means that $\tan(\theta)= \frac{y}{x}$. As such, you can see that an angle over 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees will be in a quadrant where y is positive and x is negative. This means that your value for $\sin(\theta)$ is positive and $\cos(\theta)$ is negative. Because they are not the same sign, $\tan(\theta)$ will also be negative. Graphically, $\tan(\theta)$ is represented by drawing a line tangential to your radius and reading off where that line crosses the $x$-axis. This representation can help when visualising when $\tan(\theta)$ is undetermined; the tangent line will be parallel to the $x$-axis. -->

<!-- Now the issue comes from what to do with angles greater than 360 degrees or $2 \pi$ radians? This can be solved by using the fact that all trigonometric functions are *periodic* with a period of 360 degrees or $2\pi$ radians. They repeat the same pattern, and so a value of $\sin(\theta)$ would be equal to a value of $\sin(\theta+2\pi)$ or $\sin(\theta-6\pi)$. Keep in mind, the last one works as $6\pi$ is an integer multiple of $2\pi$. It wouldn't work for $\sin(theta-3\pi)$ for this reason.  -->

## Table of common angles

When you solve problems you may need different values of these functions. For ease of use, mathematicians have created tables with most frequently used values.

# Reciprocals of trigonometric functions {-}

::: {.callout-note}

## Definitions of sec, csc, cot

In addition to $\sin(\theta)$, $\cos(\theta)$, and $\tan(\theta)$, there are three more trigonometric functions known as the **secant** $\sec(\theta)$, **cosecant** $\csc(\theta)$ and **cotangent** which are defined in the following way:

$$\sec(\theta) = \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)} \qquad \csc(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sin(\theta)}\qquad  \cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)}$$

Using the definition of $\tan(\theta) = \sin(\theta)/\cos(\theta)$, you can also say that $$\cot(\theta) = \frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sin(\theta)}.$$

<!-- $$ \qquad\qquad \cot(\theta) = \frac{adjacent\ side}{opposite\ side} $$ -->

:::

These, together with $\sin$, $\cos$ and $\tan$, are known as the **circular trigonometric functions**. Of course, there is a health warning

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

## Example 3

What is $\csc(45) + \cot(30) + \sec(60)$ equal to?

Using the definitions of $\sec, \csc$ and $\cot$, you can write $$\csc(45) + \cot(30) + \sec(60) = \frac{1}{\sin(45)} + \frac{1}{\tan(30)} + \frac{1}{\cos(60)}$$ Using the table of known angles, and not forgetting to reciprocate, gives
\begin{align*}
\csc(45) + \cot(30) + \sec(60) &= \frac{1}{\sin(45)} + \frac{1}{\tan(30)} + \frac{1}{\cos(60)}\\[1em]
&= \frac{1}{1/\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{1/\sqrt{3}} + \frac{1}{1/2} \\[1em]
&= \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3} + 2
\end{align*}
and this is as far as you can go.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

## Example 4

Prove that $\displaystyle\frac{\sin(\theta)\cot(\theta)+\cos(\theta)}{2\cot(\theta)} = \sin(\theta)$.

Start with the left hand side. Using the definition of $\cot(\theta)$ on the numerator and multiplying out, you can write that

$$\frac{\sin(\theta)\cot(\theta)+\cos(\theta)}{2\cot(\theta)} = \frac{\sin(\theta)\frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sin(\theta)}+\cos(\theta)}{2\cot(\theta)}= \frac{\cos(\theta)+\cos(\theta)}{2\cot(\theta)}$$
Now collecting together the like terms on the numerator and using the definition of $\cot(\theta)$ you can state that 
$$\frac{\cos(\theta)+\cos(\theta)}{2\cot(\theta)} = \frac{2\cos(\theta)}{2\frac{\cos(\theta)}{\sin(\theta)}} = \sin(\theta).$$
