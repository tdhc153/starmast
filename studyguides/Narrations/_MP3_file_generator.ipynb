      "SUMMARY\n",
      "The multivariate chain rule is used in calculus to differentiate a function when its variables depend on other variables. It shows how the change in one variable affects the whole function by considering how the intermediate variables change. It is useful in modelling systems where one quantity depends on several factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before reading this guide, it is recommended that you read Guide: Introduction to partial differentiation and Guide: The chain rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the multivariate chain rule?\n",
      "\n",
      "As seen in Guide: The chain rule, the chain rule tells you how to differentiate a function y equals y of x with respect to another variable t when x depends on t. normal d y over normal d t equals normal d y over normal d x normal d x over normal d t\n",
      "\n",
      "This rule can be extended to functions of multiple variables through the multivariate chain rule. The extended rule tells you how to compute derivatives of composite functions (functions of functions) involving multiple variables. It allows you to track how changes in independent variables influence a final quantity through intermediate variables called dependent variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "The multivariate chain rule is used in problems involving parametric multivariate functions, such as those describing motion along curved surfaces, transformations in computer graphics, and population models where growth depends on multiple time-varying factors. Another important example is a climate model: these use variables like temperature, humidity and ocean currents to predict weather patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before beginning, it is important to understand the difference between dependent and independent variables. From there, the multivariate chain rule accounts for any combination of dependent and independent variables; this guide looks at two dependent variables with one/two independent variables, and then discusses the general case at the very end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dependent and independent variables\n",
      "\n",
      "When a function depends on a specific variable, this means that the function is written with the variable in its rule. For example, the function f of open paren x comma y close paren equals x squared plus y squared depends on x and y as the function is written in terms of x and y.\n",
      "\n",
      "A multivariate (or multivariable) function is a function that depends on more than one variable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider a multivariate function w equals w of open paren x comma y comma z close paren equals 2 x squared plus x y plus 3 x z where 3 lines Line 1: x of open paren s comma t close paren equals s squared minus t Line 2: y of open paren s comma t close paren equals s squared plus t Line 3: z of open paren s comma t close paren equals 2 s plus t squared\n",
      "\n",
      "The variables x, y and z are referred to as dependent variables as they are functions that depend on (can be written in terms of) the variables s and t. Even though x, y and z are referred to as ‘variables’, they are actually functions of the variables s and t. In this case, the dependent variables can be written in functional form as x equals x of open paren s comma t close paren, y equals y of open paren s comma t close paren and z equals z of open paren s comma t close paren to emphasize dependency.\n",
      "\n",
      "The variables s and t are referred to as independent variables as they do not depend on any other variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "Occasionally, the dependent variables in this guide may be referred to as intermediate variables since they connect the independent variables s and t to the final quantity w.\n",
