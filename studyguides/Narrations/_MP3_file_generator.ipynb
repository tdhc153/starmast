      "Matrices are rectangular arrays of mathematical objects with entries arranged in rows and columns. Matrices are a very useful concept within mathematics, you’ll see them used for solving simultaneous equations and much more. This guide will explain what they are, some special kinds of matrices, and how to add, subtract, and scalar multiply matrices.\n",

      "\n",
      "A matrix is a rectangular array or table, with entries in rows and columns. Understanding matrices can make solving equations more efficient and can open the door to learning much more mathematics.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have read Guide: Introduction to solving simultaneous equations then one way of thinking of matrices is as an array encoding the coefficients of the variables of your simultaneous equations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Matrices are a fundamental tool within linear algebra, and they have a wide range of real-life applications. They are used in computer graphics, data analysis, search engine optimization, cryptography, economics, robotics, genetics, quantum mechanics, and many more areas of study. Matrices are used anywhere where information needs to be analyzed and calculated efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this guide, you will see how you can: read, write, and understand matrices; learn how to do addition, subtraction and scalar multiplication with matrices; and be able to identify some special matrices.\n",

      "The notation a sub i j refers to the open paren i comma j close parenth entry of your matrix, that is the number in the ith row and the jth column. An alternative way of writing the above matrix is A equals open bracket a sub i j close bracket.\n",
