      "SUMMARY\n",
      "Fractions are a fundamental concept used to represent parts of a whole. They provide a precise way to describe values that are not whole numbers, helping you to understand the relationship between different quantities. Fractions are essential in many daily tasks, such as managing finances or using recipes, and are vital in technical fields from engineering to medicine.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is a fraction?\n",
      "\n",
      "A fraction is a way of showing part of a whole object. Fractions give you a way of writing numbers that do not come out as whole numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine you cut a pizza into eight equal slices. If you eat three slices, you have eaten three eighths sans serif three eighths\n",
      "\n",
      "This means that you have eaten three out of eight slices of the whole pizza.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note\n",
      "Definition of a fraction\n",
      "\n",
      "A fraction is used to represent part of a whole. It has a numerator and a denominator, and is written in the form sans serif numerator over sans serif denominator\n",
      "\n",
      "The numerator (top number) tells you how many parts you have.\n",
      "\n",
      "The denominator (bottom number) tells you how many equal parts the whole is divided into.\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea of fractions is ancient. The Egyptians used a system for fractions around 1550 BC, but they mostly used unit fractions. These are fractions with a numerator of one (like one half or one fourth). Indian and Arabic mathematicians developed the modern style used today, where fractions are written with a numerator on top of a denominator separated by a bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the pizza example, the numerator is the three pizza slices eaten, and the denominator is the eight equal parts the whole pizza is divided into.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can move the sliders below to change the number of pizza slices shaded (numerator) and the total number of slices the pizza is divided into (denominator).\n",
      "\n",
      "Tip\n",
      "\n",
      "You can think of a fraction as: sans serif numerator over sans serif denominator equals sans serif quotation mark number you have quotation mark over sans serif quotation mark number in total quotation mark\n",
      "\n",
      "Note\n",
      "Example 1\n",
      "\n",
      "You cannot avoid fractions! They are used all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose a recipe asks for one quarter of a kilogram of flour. If you do not use fractions and guess, you might add a whole cup more, making your cake dry and crumbly!\n",
      "\n",
      "If 5 units of currency is split evenly between four people, each person gets a quarter of 5 which is 1.25. If you do not use fractions and guess, some of your friends might be unhappy!\n",
      "\n",
      "If your boss says “I will meet you here in quarter of an hour”, they are using a fraction. They mean they are expecting you to arrive in 15 minutes. This would be impossible to work out without fractions!\n",
      "\n",
      "Fractions are different from whole numbers as whole numbers are numbers which have no fractional part. In fractions, you get a whole number when the numerator can be perfectly divided by the denominator with no remainder. The horizontal bar that separates the numerator and the denominator is another way of saying division. When talking about fractions, a whole number is typically referred to as a whole. eight eighths equals 1 twelve fourths equals 3 24 over 4 equals 6\n",
      "\n",
      "Tip\n",
      "\n",
      "Any fraction for which the numerator is the same as the denominator is equivalent to one whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Types of fractions\n",
      "\n",
      "So far, you have seen how fractions represent parts of a single whole. But what happens when you have more than one whole, such as one full pizza and an extra slice? To handle amounts that are less than one, you can use proper fractions. But if you want to handle amounts which are greater than one, there are two different types of fractions you can use; improper fractions or mixed numbers. 3 lines Line 1: three eighths Line 2: sans serif three eighths Line 3: sans serif proper fraction 3 lines Line 1: seven fourths Line 2: sans serif seven quarters Line 3: sans serif improper fraction 3 lines Line 1: 1 and three fourths Line 2: sans serif one and three quarters Line 3: sans serif mixed number\n",
      "\n",
      "In each case, there is a different relationship between the numerator and the denominator. These differences are what define the three main types of fractions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note\n",
      "Types of fractions\n",
      "\n",
      "There are three types of fractions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proper fraction: A fraction where the numerator is less than the denominator.\n",
      "\n",
      "Improper fraction: A fraction where the numerator is greater than or equal to the denominator.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mixed number: A whole number and a proper fraction together.\n",
      "\n",
      "An improper fraction is also known as a “top-heavy” fraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "How does this compare to the examples from before?\n",
      "\n",
      "The fraction three eighths is a proper fraction as the numerator 3 is less than the denominator 8.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fraction seven fourths is an improper fraction as the numerator 7 is greater than or equal to the denominator 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fraction 1 and three fourths is a mixed number as it consists of a whole number 1 and a proper fraction three fourths.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note\n",
      "Example 2\n",
      "\n",
      "Below are some more examples of proper fractions, improper fractions and mixed numbers. 3 lines Line 1: sans serif Proper fractions colon one fourth one half 14 over 25 Line 2: sans serif Improper fractions colon seven fourths five halves 27 over 25 two halves Line 3: sans serif Mixed numbers colon 1 and three fourths 2 and one half 1 and 2 over 25\n",
      "\n",
      "Important\n",
      "\n",
      "You can notice that all the proper fractions are less than one whole, and that all the improper fractions are greater than or equal to one whole. This is what distinguishes these two types of fractions from each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use the sliders below to plot a fraction on the number line. For values greater than one, this interactive figure shows how an improper fraction (top) is equivalent to its mixed number form (bottom), reinforcing that they represent the same point on the line.\n",

      "Converting between improper fractions and mixed numbers\n",

      "Equivalent fractions\n",
      "\n",
      "Two fractions are called equivalent if they represent the same value, even though they have different numerators and denominators.\n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine you’re back to eating pizza. Eating two slices out of a total of four is the same as eating four slices out of a total of eight, as you have eaten one half of the whole pizza in both cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "This means that the two fractions are equivalent: two fourths equals four eighths\n",
      "\n",
      "But why are they the same? Notice that to get from two fourths to four eighths, you need to multiply both the numerator and the denominator by two.\n",

      "Creating equivalent fractions\n",
      "\n",
      "To create an equivalent fraction, multiply or divide both the numerator and the denominator by the same non-zero number. What you do to the top must be done to the bottom.\n",

      "Notice how both circles always represent the same shaded amount, demonstrating that the two fractions are equivalent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Important\n",

      "The concept of equivalent fractions also applies to negative fractions. A single negative sign can be placed with the numerator, the denominator, or in front of the entire fraction, and the value remains the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, all three of these forms represent the same value: negative three fifths equals negative 3 over 5 equals 3 over negative 5\n",
      "\n",
      "By convention, it is most common to place the sign in front of the fraction, like negative three fifths.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, positive fractions are equivalent to fractions with a negative numerator and a negative denominator as the multiplier is negative 1. three fifths equals sign with times negative 1 over it negative 3 over negative 5\n",
      "\n",
      "Finding equivalent fractions is necessary for comparing fractions, performing calculations with fractions, and developing good habits for later topics such as those explored in Guide: Arithmetic on numerical fractions, Guide: Introduction to algebraic fractions and Guide: Arithmetic on algebraic fractions. They are particularly helpful when you need to add together two fractions with different denominators.\n",
      "\n",
      "The case of dividing the numerator and the denominator by the same number to find an equivalent fraction has a specific name. This is the topic of the next section.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simplifying fractions\n",
      "\n",
      "In the previous section, you saw how to create equivalent fractions by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the same number, such as changing two thirds into 10 over 15. You can also go in the other direction. The process of dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the same number is called simplifying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simplifying is how you find the lowest terms version of a fraction. In the pizza example, two fourths is equivalent to one half. Simplifying is the formal process for getting from two fourths back to one half. two fourths equals the fraction with numerator 2 divided by 2 and denominator 4 divided by 2 equals one half\n",
