      "SUMMARY\n",
      "Complex numbers are an extremely important concept in mathematics, as you can express a solution to any algebraic equation using complex numbers. This guide introduces the idea of a complex number in the form z equals a plus b i, as well as the concepts of real and imaginary parts, complex conjugates, and Argand diagrams.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is a complex number?\n",
      "\n",
      "Real numbers, which consist of all possible decimal numbers, can do lots of things very well. For instance, you can measure all possible lengths using real numbers, which you cannot do using rational numbers a divided by b with a comma b whole numbers and b non-zero. You can also solve any equation a x equals b for x, with a comma b non-zero real numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "But real numbers cannot do everything. Consider the equation x squared equals negative 1 period Since the square of any real number is greater than or equal to 0, it follows that this equation has no solutions which are real numbers. So you will have to look elsewhere for the solution to such an equation; perhaps defining a new kind of number. Setting i to be a number such that i squared equals negative 1 solves this issue; this i is known as the imaginary unit.\n",
      "\n",
      "It turns out that introducing this imaginary unit i is enough to express solutions to all equations involving an x squared term, known as quadratic equations; for more on these, see Guide: Introduction to quadratic equations. By using this imaginary unit as the basis for a new number system containing the real numbers, you can solve all possible quadratic equations. This number system is known as the complex numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Complex numbers appear almost everywhere in mathematics. Aside from being used to solve any quadratic equation, they have important applications in the theory of numbers more generally, in higher forms of algebra, the study of functions, the theory of electromagnetism, solving differential equations, and even measuring the motion of tornadoes!\n",
      "\n",
      "This guide will focus on introducing the concept of a complex number, with the exact definition of complex numbers together with some initial examples of complex numbers. Then, the concepts of real and imaginary parts of complex numbers are explored, the complex conjugate is defined, and the pictorial representation of a complex number via Argand diagrams is explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "Initial definitions of complex numbers\n",
      "\n",
      "The key concept that separates complex numbers from real numbers is the existence of the imaginary unit, otherwise known as i;\n",
      "\n",
      "Definition of the imaginary unit\n",
      "\n",
      "The imaginary unit i is defined by the fact that i squared equals negative 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Important\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes the imaginary unit is written by j instead of i. This is often used in contexts where i means something else, such as in engineering and in the programming language Python.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, you can use the imaginary unit to define a complex number:\n",
      "\n",
      "Definition of a complex number\n",
      "\n",
      "Any number z equals a plus b i where a and b are real numbers is called a complex number.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tip\n",
      "\n",
      "The set of all complex numbers is called the complex numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes a complex number z equals a plus b i can be written as z equals a plus i b. This particularly happens when b is a square root such as the square root of 5, or the output of a function such as sine x.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example 1\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some complex numbers: z sub 1 equals 1 plus 3 i, z sub 2 equals negative 4 plus 6 i, z sub 3 equals 8 divided by 3 minus 13 i divided by 5, z sub 4 equals negative pi minus i pi. Some more complex numbers are z sub 5 equals 0 plus 4 i equals 4 i and z sub 6 equals negative 2 plus 0 i equals negative 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can notice that in Example 1, z sub 5 and z sub 6 have a equals 0 and b equals 0 respectively. These are examples of some special kinds of complex numbers:\n",
      "\n",
      "If b equals 0, then z equals a is known as real number. So every real number is also a complex number.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a equals 0, then z equals b i is known as a purely imaginary number.\n",
      "\n",
      "Square roots of negative numbers\n",
      "\n",
      "You will notice that i is defined by the fact that i squared equals negative 1. It is very important to say that i is not the only solution to the equation x squared equals negative 1. Considering open paren negative i close paren squared and using the laws of indices (see Guide: Laws of indices) gives open paren negative i close paren squared equals open paren negative 1 times i close paren squared equals open paren negative 1 close paren squared times i squared equals 1 times negative 1 equals negative 1 and so negative i is also a solution to x squared equals negative 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Purely imaginary numbers are used to express solutions to the equation x squared equals negative a, where a is greater than 0 is a positive real number.\n",
      "\n",
      "Solutions to x squared equals negative a\n",
      "\n",
      "Let a is greater than 0 be a positive real number. Then the solutions to x squared equals negative a are given by x equals i the square root of a and x equals negative i the square root of a period\n",
      "\n",
      "Example 2\n",
      "\n",
      "The two solutions of x squared equals negative 64 are x equals 8 i and x equals negative 8 i.\n",
      "\n",
      "The two solutions of x squared equals negative 3 are x equals i the square root of 3 and x equals negative i the square root of 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Real and imaginary parts\n",
      "\n",
      "The real numbers a comma b that form the two separate parts of the complex number z equals a plus b i have special names. These real numbers can be recovered from the complex number by taking real and imaginary parts:\n",
      "\n",
      "Definition of real and imaginary parts\n",
      "\n",
      "If z equals a plus b i is a complex number, then:\n",
      "\n",
      "the real part real z of z is defined to be real z equals a,\n",
      "\n",
      "the imaginary part imaginary z of z is defined to be imaginary z equals b, the coefficient of i in z equals a plus b i.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes, the real part of a complex number is written as normal fraktur cap R of z, and the imaginary part as normal fraktur cap I of z.\n",
      "\n",
      "Warning\n",
      "\n",
      "The real and imaginary parts of a complex number z equals a plus b i are real numbers, so your answer should not involve the imaginary unit.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this language, a complex number z is real if and only if imaginary z equals 0; a complex number z is purely imaginary if and only if real z equals 0.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example 3\n",
      "\n",
      "In Example 1, you saw six complex numbers z sub 1 to z sub 6. Here, their real and imaginary parts are given.\n",
      "\n",
      "The real part of z sub 1 equals 1 plus 3 i is the real of open paren z sub 1 close paren equals 1, and the imaginary part of z sub 1 is the imaginary of open paren z sub 1 close paren equals 3.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The real part of z sub 3 equals 8 divided by 3 minus 13 i divided by 5 is the real of open paren z sub 3 close paren equals 8 divided by 3, and the imaginary part of z sub 3 is the imaginary of open paren z sub 3 close paren equals negative 13 divided by 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "The real part of z sub 4 equals negative pi minus i pi is the real of open paren z sub 4 close paren equals negative pi, and the imaginary part of z sub 4 is the imaginary of open paren z sub 4 close paren equals negative pi.\n",
      "\n",
      "The real part of z sub 5 equals 4 i is the real of open paren z sub 5 close paren equals 0, as z sub 5 equals 4 i equals 0 plus 4 i. The imaginary part of z sub 5 is the imaginary of open paren z sub 5 close paren equals 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "The real part of z sub 6 equals negative 2 is the real of open paren z sub 6 close paren equals negative 2. The imaginary part of z sub 6 is the imaginary of open paren z sub 6 close paren equals 0, as z sub 6 equals negative 2 equals negative 2 plus 0 i.\n",
      "\n",
      "The complex conjugate\n",
      "\n",
      "You saw in the previous section on square roots of negative numbers that the solutions to negative a squared are i the square root of a and negative i the square root of a, where a is a positive number. As it turns out, this is an example of a more general phenomenon known as the complex conjugate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Definition of the complex conjugate\n",
      "\n",
      "If z equals a plus b i is a complex number, then the complex conjugate z bar (or z raised to the asterisk power) of z is the complex number z bar equals a minus b i.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the complex conjugate of z equals a plus b i is the complex number with the same real part and with the sign of the imaginary part switched from either plus to minus or from minus to plus. Let’s take a look at some examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "Example 4\n",
      "\n",
      "In Example 1, you saw six complex numbers z sub 1 to z sub 6. Here, their complex conjugates are given.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The complex conjugate of z sub 3 equals 8 divided by 3 minus 13 i divided by 5 is z bar sub 3 equals 8 divided by 3 plus 13 i divided by 5.\n",

      "\n",
      "The complex conjugate of z sub 5 equals 4 i is z bar sub 5 equals negative 4 i.\n",
      "\n",
      "The complex conjugate of z sub 6 equals negative 2 is z bar sub 6 equals negative 2. Notice that taking the complex conjugate of any real number gives that same real number again!\n",
      "\n",
      "You can see from Examples 2 and 3 (and the definition of complex conjugate) that if real z equals a then the real of open paren z bar close paren equals a, and if imaginary z equals b then the imaginary of open paren z bar close paren equals negative b.\n",
      "\n",
      "Argand diagrams\n",
      "\n",
      "Because every complex number is writable as a plus b i for a comma b is a member of the real numbers, you can express every complex number a plus b i as a point open paren a comma b close paren in two-dimensional space. Such a graph is known as an Argand diagram.\n",
      "\n",
      "An Argand diagram has two axes called the real and imaginary axes. The real axis takes the place of the x-axis and the imaginary axis takes the place of the y-axis. See Figure 1 for more.\n",
      "\n",
      "To draw a complex number on an Argand diagram, you can plot the complex number z equals a plus b i at the point open paren a comma b close paren equals open paren sans serif real z comma sans serif imaginary z close paren.
