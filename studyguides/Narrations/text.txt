SUMMARY
Partial differentiation is a key technique used in calculus for dealing with functions of multiple variables. It focuses on how a function changes with respect to one variable while keeping others constant. It is widely used in physics, economics, and engineering to analyse systems involving multiple changing factors, such as in heat flow or optimization.

Before reading this guide, it is recommended that you read Guide: Introduction to differentiation and the derivative, Guide: The chain rule, Guide: The product rule, and Guide: The quotient rule.

What is partial differentiation?

As explained in Guide: Introduction to differentiation and the derivative, a derivative measures how a function changes as its input changes. For example, if you have a function f of x, the derivative f prime of x describes the rate at which f changes with respect to x. f prime of x equals lim over h right arrow 0 of open paren the fraction with numerator f of open paren x plus h close paren minus f of x and denominator h close paren

However, in many real-world examples, functions depend on more than one variable. For example, weather prediction involves functions that depend on pressure, humidity and time. In economics, profit might depend on both price and production level. The process of partial differentiation is essential if you want to understand the influence of each variable separately.

For a function f of open paren x comma y close paren that depends on two variables x and y, partial differentiation allows you to study the change in f by considering the change in one variable at a time. If you choose to study the change in f by considering the change in x, you need to hold y fixed. In this case, y is treated as a constant as it doesn’t change during this process.

This guide explains the idea of partial differentiation and how it is different from standard single-variable differentiation. It will explain how to find partial derivatives, the concept of second-order partial derivatives, and how to partially differentiate a function with any finite number of variables.

Definition of the partial derivative

Consider a surface (some bumpy terrain) shown in the 3D graph below. A surface z equals f of open paren x comma y close paren can be defined as a function of x and y. This means that for any values of x and y, the function returns a value z representing the height of the surface at the point open paren x comma y close paren.

A partial derivative measures how the surface changes in a single direction while keeping the other variable constant. To understand how the surface changes with respect to x, fix a value of y, say y equals 1. The surface z equals f of open paren x comma y close paren is a function of x and y, but when y equals 1 the surface reduces to a curve z equals f of open paren x comma 1 close paren equals f of x in the x z-plane. This shows how the height z depends on x alone when y is fixed at 1.

The 3D graph illustrates the surface with a vertical plane sliding through it at a chosen value of y equals a. The points where the plane intersects the surface form a curve (shown in yellow). You can use the slider to change the value of a which will change the position of the vertical plane and the shape of the curve. The 2D graph displays this curve separately.

Imagine you are following a path across a bumpy terrain where you don’t change direction. As you go up and down the hills and valleys, you will trace out a curve that shows how the height changes along that path. The slope of this curve at any point tells you how steeply the surface is rising or falling in that direction. This is what the partial derivative measures.

As seen in Guide: Introduction to differentiation and the derivative, you can approximate the gradient of this function at a point by looking at how much the function’s value changes over a small step. By fixing y and observing how the function changes with respect to x, you’re treating the surface as a single-variable function. The slope of the curve at a point gives the partial derivative with respect to x, evaluated at that value of y.

Definition of the partial derivative

For a function f of open paren x comma y close paren, the partial derivative with respect to x is written as the fraction with numerator partial f and denominator partial x.

It is defined by the limit the fraction with numerator partial f and denominator partial x equals lim over h right arrow 0 of open paren the fraction with numerator f of open paren x plus h comma y close paren minus f of open paren x comma y close paren and denominator h close paren

This definition is similar to that of single-variable differentiation, with the key difference that y is treated as a constant during the process.

Similarly, the partial derivative with respect to y is defined by the limit the fraction with numerator partial f and denominator partial y equals lim over h right arrow 0 of open paren the fraction with numerator f of open paren x comma y plus h close paren minus f of open paren x comma y close paren and denominator h close paren

When differentiating with respect to some variable, all other variables are held fixed (they do not change) and they should be treated as you would normally treat constants.

You may sometimes see the notation f sub x to mean the partial derivative of f with respect to x.

Important

Partial derivatives are always written using a curly partial as opposed to a straight normal d as in single-variable differentiation.

An important distinction is that if a function depends only on x, then the fraction with numerator partial f and denominator partial x equals normal d f over normal d x as there is no other variable to hold fixed.

Finding partial derivatives

To finding a partial derivative, start by identifying the variable you want to differentiate with respect to. For example, if you want to find the partial derivative of f with respect to x, treat x as the variable to differentiate with respect to.

The golden rule of partial differentiation is as follows:

Golden rule of partial differentiation

When differentiating with respect to some variable, treat all other variables as constants.

If required, apply any rules of differentiation such as the sum/difference rule chain rule, product rule or quotient rule. These rules from single-variable differentiation still apply to partial differentiation, but they must be applied with respect to the chosen variable only and (again) you must treat all other variables as constants. This can involve a lot of lengthy working, so take your time, especially when combining multiple rules.

For a reminder on how to apply these techniques, please see Guide: Introduction to differentiation and the derivative, Guide: The chain rule, Guide: The product rule, and Guide: The quotient rule.

Example 1

Consider the function f of open paren x comma y close paren equals x squared plus y squared.

To find the partial derivative with respect to x, first differentiate x squared with respect to x using the power rule to get 2 x. Importantly, the term y squared is a constant with respect to x so its partial derivative with respect to x is 0. So: 3 lines Line 1: the fraction with numerator partial f and denominator partial x equals the fraction with numerator partial and denominator partial x times open paren x squared plus y squared close paren Line 2: blank equals the fraction with numerator partial and denominator partial x times open paren x squared close paren plus the fraction with numerator partial and denominator partial x times open paren y squared close paren Line 3: blank equals 2 x plus 0 equals 2 x

To find the partial derivative with respect to y, first differentiate y squared with respect to y using the power rule to get 2 y. Importantly, the term x squared is a constant with respect to y so its partial derivative with respect to y is 0. 3 lines Line 1: the fraction with numerator partial f and denominator partial y equals the fraction with numerator partial and denominator partial y times open paren x squared plus y squared close paren Line 2: blank equals the fraction with numerator partial and denominator partial y times open paren x squared close paren plus the fraction with numerator partial and denominator partial y times open paren y squared close paren Line 3: blank equals 0 plus 2 y equals 2 y

Example 2

Consider the function f of open paren x comma y close paren equals 3 x squared y plus 4 x y cubed.

To find the partial derivative with respect to x, first differentiate 3 x squared y with respect to x to get 6 x y. Now differentiate 4 x y cubed with respect to x to get 4 y cubed. Once again, y is treated as a constant. 4 lines Line 1: the fraction with numerator partial f and denominator partial x equals the fraction with numerator partial and denominator partial x times open paren 3 x squared y plus 4 x y cubed close paren Line 2: blank equals the fraction with numerator partial and denominator partial x times open paren 3 x squared y close paren plus the fraction with numerator partial and denominator partial x times open paren 4 x y cubed close paren Line 3: blank equals 3 y the fraction with numerator partial and denominator partial x times open paren x squared close paren plus 4 y cubed the fraction with numerator partial and denominator partial x times x Line 4: blank equals 3 y times 2 x plus 4 y cubed times 1 equals 6 x y plus 4 y cubed

To find the partial derivative with respect to y, first differentiate 3 x squared y with respect to y to get 3 x squared. Now differentiate 4 x y cubed with respect to y to get 12 x y squared. Notice that in this case, x is treated as a constant. 4 lines Line 1: the fraction with numerator partial f and denominator partial y equals the fraction with numerator partial and denominator partial y times open paren 3 x squared y plus 4 x y cubed close paren Line 2: blank equals the fraction with numerator partial and denominator partial y times open paren 3 x squared y close paren plus the fraction with numerator partial and denominator partial y times open paren 4 x y cubed close paren Line 3: blank equals 3 x squared the fraction with numerator partial and denominator partial y times y plus 4 x the fraction with numerator partial and denominator partial y times open paren y cubed close paren Line 4: blank equals 3 x squared times 1 plus 4 x times 3 y squared equals 3 x squared plus 12 x y squared

Example 3

Consider the function f of open paren x comma y close paren equals x squared times open paren 3 x plus y squared close paren cubed.

Start by finding the partial derivative with respect to x. Notice that f of open paren x comma y close paren is a product of the two functions x squared and open paren 3 x plus y squared close paren cubed. You need to use the product rule to differentiate the product x squared times open paren 3 x plus y squared close paren cubed with respect to x. Then, you need to differentiate open paren 3 x plus y squared close paren cubed with respect to x using the chain rule. Remember to treat y squared as a constant. 4 lines Line 1: the fraction with numerator partial f and denominator partial x equals the fraction with numerator partial and denominator partial x times open bracket x squared times open paren 3 x plus y squared close paren cubed close bracket Line 2: blank equals x squared the fraction with numerator partial and denominator partial x times open bracket open paren 3 x plus y squared close paren cubed close bracket plus open paren 3 x plus y squared close paren cubed times the fraction with numerator partial and denominator partial x times open bracket x squared close bracket Line 3: blank equals x squared times 9 times open paren 3 x plus y squared close paren squared plus open paren 3 x plus y squared close paren cubed times 2 x Line 4: blank equals 9 x squared times open paren 3 x plus y squared close paren squared plus 2 x times open paren 3 x plus y squared close paren cubed

Now find the partial derivative with respect to y. Notice that f of open paren x comma y close paren is a product of the two functions x squared and open paren 3 x plus y squared close paren cubed however only the second function is a function of y. Therefore, this doesn’t require the product rule to differentiate as x squared is treated as a constant. The second function still requires you to use the chain rule. 2 lines Line 1: the fraction with numerator partial f and denominator partial y equals the fraction with numerator partial and denominator partial y times open bracket x squared times open paren 3 x plus y squared close paren cubed close bracket equals x squared the fraction with numerator partial and denominator partial y times open bracket open paren 3 x plus y squared close paren cubed close bracket Line 2: blank equals x squared times 6 y times open paren 3 x plus y squared close paren squared equals 6 x squared y times open paren 3 x plus y squared close paren squared

Higher-order partial derivatives

As with single-variable functions, you can take partial derivatives of partial derivatives to get second-order partial derivatives. For a function of two variables f of open paren x comma y close paren, there are four second-order partial derivatives, one for each combination of variables.

Second-order partial derivatives

Much like in differentiation in a single variable, second-order partial derivatives are the partial derivatives of first-order partial derivatives.

For a function f of two variables x and y, the pure second-order partial derivatives are defined as: 2 lines Line 1: f sub x x equals the fraction with numerator partial squared f and denominator partial x squared equals the fraction with numerator partial and denominator partial x times open paren the fraction with numerator partial f and denominator partial x close paren Line 2: f sub y y equals the fraction with numerator partial squared f and denominator partial y squared equals the fraction with numerator partial and denominator partial y times open paren the fraction with numerator partial f and denominator partial y close paren

To compute a pure second-order partial derivative, you need to differentiate a first-order partial derivative with respect to the same variable again.

For a function f of two variables x and y, the mixed second-order partial derivatives are defined as: 2 lines Line 1: f sub x y equals the fraction with numerator partial squared f and denominator partial y partial x equals the fraction with numerator partial and denominator partial y times open paren the fraction with numerator partial f and denominator partial x close paren Line 2: f sub y x equals the fraction with numerator partial squared f and denominator partial x partial y equals the fraction with numerator partial and denominator partial x times open paren the fraction with numerator partial f and denominator partial y close paren

To compute a mixed second-order partial derivative, you need to differentiate a first-order partial derivative with respect to a different variable.

Warning

The order in which the subscript variables are written above is not a typo! For the two notation systems, there are different conventions for denoting the order in which differentiation occurs.

Under certain conditions, the mixed second-order partial derivatives are equal. This is called Schwarz’s Theorem.

Schwarz’s theorem

If the fraction with numerator partial f and denominator partial x and the fraction with numerator partial f and denominator partial y are continuous and differentiable, then the fraction with numerator partial squared f and denominator partial x partial y equals the fraction with numerator partial squared f and denominator partial y partial x

Please see [Guide: Introduction to continuity] and [Guide: Introduction to differentiability] for more detailed analyses of what makes functions continuous and differentiable.

Example 4

Consider the function f of open paren x comma y close paren equals sine x y plus x to the fourth power y squared plus x cubed y cubed plus 3 x.

The first-order partial derivatives are given by 2 lines Line 1: the fraction with numerator partial f and denominator partial x equals y cosine x y plus 4 x cubed y squared plus 3 x squared y cubed plus 3 Line 2: the fraction with numerator partial f and denominator partial y equals x cosine x y plus 2 x to the fourth power y plus 3 x cubed y squared

The second-order partial derivatives can be calculated from the first-order partial derivatives. 4 lines Line 1: the fraction with numerator partial squared f and denominator partial x squared equals the fraction with numerator partial and denominator partial x times open paren the fraction with numerator partial f and denominator partial x close paren equals negative y squared sine x y plus 12 x squared y squared plus 6 x y cubed Line 2: the fraction with numerator partial squared f and denominator partial y squared equals the fraction with numerator partial and denominator partial y times open paren the fraction with numerator partial f and denominator partial y close paren equals negative x squared sine x y plus 2 x to the fourth power plus 6 x cubed y Line 3: the fraction with numerator partial squared f and denominator partial x partial y equals the fraction with numerator partial and denominator partial x times open paren the fraction with numerator partial f and denominator partial y close paren equals cosine x y minus x y sine x y plus 8 x cubed y plus 9 x squared y squared Line 4: the fraction with numerator partial squared f and denominator partial y partial x equals the fraction with numerator partial and denominator partial y times open paren the fraction with numerator partial f and denominator partial x close paren equals cosine x y minus x y sine x y plus 8 x cubed y plus 9 x squared y squared

Notice that Schwarz’s Theorem holds as the first-order partial derivatives are continuous and differentiable and the fraction with numerator partial squared f and denominator partial x partial y equals the fraction with numerator partial squared f and denominator partial y partial x period

Functions of more than two variables

Partial differentiation is not limited to functions of two variables. Many real-world problems involve functions of many more variables. For example, the temperature in a room might depend on position open paren x comma y comma z close paren and time t.

In general, if f equals f of open paren x sub 1 comma x sub 2 comma dot dot dot comma x sub n close paren, you can compute the partial derivative of f with respect to any one variable by treating all other variables as constants.

Definition of the partial derivative for functions of n variables

For a function f of open paren x sub 1 comma x sub 2 comma dot dot dot comma x sub n close paren of n variables, the partial derivative with respect to x sub i is denoted by the fraction with numerator partial f and denominator partial x sub i sans serif or f sub x sub i

It is defined by the limit the fraction with numerator partial f and denominator partial x sub i equals lim over h right arrow 0 of open paren the fraction with numerator f of open paren x sub 1 comma dot dot dot comma x sub i plus h comma dot dot dot comma x sub n close paren minus f of open paren x sub 1 comma dot dot dot comma x sub i comma dot dot dot comma x sub n close paren and denominator h close paren

This is a natural extension of the two-variable case from before. When differentiating with respect to x sub i, all other variables are held fixed.

Example 5

Consider the function f of open paren x comma y comma z comma t close paren equals l n of open paren x squared plus y squared plus 1 close paren plus e raised to the x z t power plus y the sine of open paren z plus t close paren.

As an example, to find the first-order partial derivative with respect to x, you need to differentiate f with respect to x while holding y, z and t constant.

The first-order partial derivatives are given by 4 lines Line 1: the fraction with numerator partial f and denominator partial x equals the fraction with numerator 2 x and denominator x squared plus y squared plus 1 plus z t e raised to the x z t power Line 2: the fraction with numerator partial f and denominator partial y equals the fraction with numerator 2 y and denominator x squared plus y squared plus 1 plus the sine of open paren z plus t close paren Line 3: the fraction with numerator partial f and denominator partial z equals x t e raised to the x z t power plus y the cosine of open paren z plus t close paren Line 4: the fraction with numerator partial f and denominator partial t equals x z e raised to the x z t power plus y the cosine of open paren z plus t close paren

You can also calculate various higher order partial derivatives for each variable by taking partial derivatives of these first-order partial derivatives.
