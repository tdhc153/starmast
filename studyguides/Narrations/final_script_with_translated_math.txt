SUMMARY
Matrices are rectangular arrays of mathematical objects with entries arranged in rows and columns. Matrices are a very useful concept within mathematics, you’ll see them used for solving simultaneous equations and much more. This guide will explain what they are, some special kinds of matrices, and how to add, subtract, and scalar multiply matrices.

What is a matrix?

A matrix is a rectangular array or table, with entries in rows and columns. Understanding matrices can make solving equations more efficient and can open the door to learning much more mathematics.

If you have read Guide: Introduction to solving simultaneous equations then one way of thinking of matrices is as an array encoding the coefficients of the variables of your simultaneous equations.

Matrices are a fundamental tool within linear algebra, and they have a wide range of real-life applications. They are used in computer graphics, data analysis, search engine optimization, cryptography, economics, robotics, genetics, quantum mechanics, and many more areas of study. Matrices are used anywhere where information needs to be analyzed and calculated efficiently.

In this guide, you will see how you can: read, write, and understand matrices; learn how to do addition, subtraction and scalar multiplication with matrices; and be able to identify some special matrices.

Working with matrices

Note
Definition of a matrix

A m times n matrix A is a rectangular array of m n many numbers (called entries) set out in m rows and n columns. You can write it like so:

A equals the 4 by 4 matrix Row 1: Column 1, a sub 11 Column 2, a sub 12 Column 3, dot dot dot Column 4, a sub 1 n Row 2: Column 1, a sub 21 Column 2, a sub 22 Column 3, dot dot dot Column 4, a sub 2 n Row 3: Column 1, vertical ellipsis Column 2, vertical ellipsis Column 3, down right diagonal ellipsis Column 4, vertical ellipsis Row 4: Column 1, a sub m 1 Column 2, a sub m 2 Column 3, dot dot dot Column 4, a sub m n

This matrix has dimension m times n.

The notation a sub i j refers to the open paren i comma j close parenth entry of your matrix, that is the number in the ith row and the jth column. An alternative way of writing the above matrix is A equals open bracket a sub i j close bracket.

You can specify the open paren i comma j close parenth entry a sub i j of a particular matrix A by writing open bracket A close bracket sub i j equals a sub i j.

Tip

The entries in a matrix are usually numbers, but they can be other mathematical objects. Any type of number could be an entry in a matrix, positive or negative, rational or irrational, real or complex. (If complex numbers are unfamiliar to you, you can read more about them at Guide: Introduction to complex numbers.

Note that while entries can be other mathematical objects, for this study guide you will exclusively use entries within the real numbers.

Note
Example 1

Here are some matrices:

A equals the 3 by 2 matrix Row 1: Column 1, 0 Column 2, negative 2 Row 2: Column 1, pi Column 2, 5 Row 3: Column 1, 1 divided by 3 Column 2, 0 comma sans serif and B equals the 1 by 4 row matrix Column 1: negative 1 Column 2: 2 divided by 5 Column 3: 0 Column 4: the square root of 3

As A has three rows and two columns, it has dimension 3 times 2. The entry in the 2nd row and 1st column is called a sub 21 equals open bracket A close bracket sub 21, and here that is equal to pi. The entry in the 1st row and 2nd column is called a sub 12 equals open bracket A close bracket sub 21, and here that is equal to negative 2. You can notice here that a sub 21 is not equal to a sub 12.

Matrix B here has dimension 1 times 4, as it has one row and four columns. The entry in the 1st row and 2nd column is called b sub 12 equals open bracket B close bracket sub 12, and here that is equal to 2 divided by 5. The entry in the 1st row and 4th column is called b sub 14 equals open bracket B close bracket sub 12, and here that is equal to the square root of 3.

C equals the 3 by 1 column matrix Row 1: the square root of 2 Row 2: 11 Row 3: negative 3 divided by 8 comma and D equals the 5 by 3 matrix Row 1: Column 1, negative 5 Column 2, 1 divided by 2 Column 3, 0 Row 2: Column 1, 0 Column 2, 7 Column 3, 4 divided by 9 Row 3: Column 1, negative pi Column 2, 0 Column 3, the negative square root of 3 Row 4: Column 1, negative 1 Column 2, 5 Column 3, 0 Row 5: Column 1, 1 divided by 4 Column 2, 0 Column 3, 8

Matrix C has dimension 3 times 1, as it has three rows and one column.

As D has five rows and three columns, the matrix D has dimension 5 times 3.

You can notice that B only has one row; you can call such a matrix a row matrix. Similarly, you would call a matrix like C, with only one column, a column matrix. These are commonly known as vectors. You can read more about vectors in Guide: Introduction to vectors.

One important set of entries in a matrix is the main diagonal:

Note
Definition of a main diagonal

For a m times n matrix A equals open bracket a sub i j close bracket, the entries a sub 11 comma a sub 22 comma dot dot dot comma a sub k k make up the main diagonal of A. This is where

k equals m if m is less than n

k equals n if n is less than or equal to m.

You can write the main diagonal using this notation:

sans serif diag A equals open paren a sub 11 comma a sub 22 comma dot dot dot comma a sub k k close paren

which state the entries of the main diagonal.

Warning

sans serif diag A equals open paren a sub 11 comma a sub 22 comma dot dot dot comma a sub n n close paren is not a matrix, but a set of entries of the matrix.

Note
Example 3

What are the main diagonals of the matrices in Example 1?

Since A is a 3 times 2 matrix, it follows that n is less than m and so k equals 2, meaning the main diagonal of A is sans serif diag A equals open paren a sub 11 comma a sub 22 close paren equals open paren 0 comma 5 close paren. You can see these entries highlighted in bold below:

A equals the 3 by 2 matrix Row 1: Column 1, bold 0 Column 2, negative 2 Row 2: Column 1, pi Column 2, bold 5 Row 3: Column 1, 1 divided by 3 Column 2, 0

Since B is a 1 times 4 matrix, it follows that m is less than n and so k equals 1, meaning the main diagonal of B is sans serif diag B equals open paren b sub 11 close paren equals negative 1. You can see this entry highlighted in bold below: B equals the 1 by 4 row matrix Column 1: negative bold 1 Column 2: 2 divided by 5 Column 3: 0 Column 4: the square root of 3

You do not need to be so thorough every time. You can read off the main diagonals of C and D (entries highlighted in bold):

C equals the 3 by 1 column matrix Row 1: the square root of bold 2 Row 2: 11 Row 3: negative 3 divided by 8 and D equals the 5 by 3 matrix Row 1: Column 1, negative bold 5 Column 2, 1 divided by 2 Column 3, 0 Row 2: Column 1, 0 Column 2, bold 7 Column 3, 4 divided by 9 Row 3: Column 1, pi Column 2, 0 Column 3, the negative square root of bold 3 Row 4: Column 1, negative 1 Column 2, 5 Column 3, 0 Row 5: Column 1, 1 divided by 4 Column 2, 0 Column 3, 8

to say sans serif diag C equals open paren the square root of 2 close paren sans serif and sans serif diag D equals open paren negative 5 comma 7 comma the negative square root of 3 close paren period

Special matrices

There are special matrices that often appear in mathematics and statistics.

Zero matrix

There exists a special class of matrices where all of the entries are zero; they are somewhat uninspiringly called the zero matrices.

Note
Definition of a zero matrix

The m times n zero matrix 0 sub m times n is the m times n matrix where all entries are 0.

Note
Example 3

Here are some zero matrices: 0 sub 1 times 3 equals the 1 by 3 row matrix 0 0 0 comma 0 sub 3 times 1 equals the 3 by 1 column matrix 0 0 0 comma 0 sub 4 times 3 equals the 4 by 3 matrix Row 1: Column 1, 0 Column 2, 0 Column 3, 0 Row 2: Column 1, 0 Column 2, 0 Column 3, 0 Row 3: Column 1, 0 Column 2, 0 Column 3, 0 Row 4: Column 1, 0 Column 2, 0 Column 3, 0

There exists one zero matrix for every ordered pair of positive numbers open paren m comma n close paren. There is one warning to say though:

Warning

If m is not equal to n, then 0 sub m times n is not equal to 0 sub n times m, as the matrices have different shapes! You saw this in Example 3, where 0 sub 1 times 3 is not equal to 0 sub 3 times 1.

Finally, here’s a way to define zero matrices using the alternative definition of a matrix.

Tip

You can use the alternate way of writing a matrix to define the zero matrix: 0 sub m times n equals open bracket a sub i j close bracket where a sub i j equals 0 for 1 is less than or equal to i is less than or equal to m and 1 is less than or equal to j is less than or equal to n period This way of defining matrices is incredibly common in computer coding, as it relies on for loops.

Square matrix

The only time 0 sub m times n equals 0 sub n times m is if m equals n. Then, the number of rows equals the number of columns, and so the matrix is square. This is precisely the definition of a square matrix:

Note
Definition of a square matrix

A matrix A is a square matrix if the number of rows of A equals the number of columns of A. So an m times n matrix is square if m equals n.

Note
Example 4

Here are some square matrices: E equals the 4 by 4 matrix Row 1: Column 1, 0 Column 2, negative 4 Column 3, pi Column 4, 6 Row 2: Column 1, e Column 2, negative 1 Column 3, 1 Column 4, 1 Row 3: Column 1, 6 Column 2, 6 Column 3, 6 Column 4, 6 Row 4: Column 1, 9 Column 2, 4 Column 3, 3 Column 4, negative 2 comma F equals the 2 by 2 matrix Row 1: 1 1 Row 2: 0 1 comma 0 sub 3 times 3 equals the 3 by 3 matrix Row 1: 0 0 0 Row 2: 0 0 0 Row 3: 0 0 0

Upper and lower triangular matrices

A special kind of square matrix are upper and lower triangular matrices, where a large portion of the entries are 0.

Note
Definition of upper and lower triangular matrices

Suppose that A comma B are n times n square matrices. A matrix A is an upper triangular matrix if every entry below the main diagonal of A is 0. Similarly, B is a lower triangular matrix if every entry above the main diagonal of B is 0.

Note
Example 4

None of the matrices in Example 1 are upper or lower triangular, as they are all not square. The matrix E in Example 2 is not upper triangular, as there is only one entry equalling 0 and it is on the main diagonal.

The matrix F in Example 2 is upper triangular, as all the entries below the main diagonal are 0. You can see this in the recreation of F below, where the main diagonal is highlighted in bold:

F equals the 2 by 2 matrix Row 1: bold 1 1 Row 2: 0 bold 1

The zero matrix 0 sub 3 times 3 is both upper and lower triangular; as the entries both above and below the main diagonal are 0. The main diagonal is highlighted in bold to help you visualise this: 0 sub 3 times 3 equals the 3 by 3 matrix Row 1: bold 0 0 0 Row 2: 0 bold 0 0 Row 3: 0 0 bold 0

Tip

Similar to the zero matrices, you can use alternative definitions to specify upper and lower triangular matrices in more detail. For instance, for an n times n upper triangular matrix A: A equals open bracket a sub i j close bracket where a sub i j equals 0 for 1 is less than or equal to i is less than j is less than or equal to n and an n times n lower triangular matrix B can be defined by B equals open bracket b sub i j close bracket where a sub i j equals 0 for 1 is less than or equal to j is less than i is less than or equal to n period

Diagonal matrices

Note
Definition of a diagonal matrix

Let D be a square n times n matrix. Then D is a diagonal matrix if all entries not on the main diagonal are 0.

This means that diagonal matrices are both upper and lower triangular matrices. So if a matrix is not upper triangular, then it can’t possibly be a diagonal matrix.

Note
Example 5

The matrix F in Example 2 is not diagonal. Although it is upper triangular, as all the entries below the main diagonal are 0, it is not diagonal as there is a non-zero entry 1 above the main diagonal.

F equals the 2 by 2 matrix Row 1: bold 1 1 Row 2: 0 bold 1

The following matrices are all diagonal, with the main diagonal highlighted in bold so you can see that the entries above and below are all 0;

G equals the 3 by 3 matrix Row 1: bold 0 0 0 Row 2: 0 negative bold 1 0 Row 3: 0 0 negative bold 1 comma H equals the 2 by 2 matrix Row 1: bold 76 0 Row 2: 0 negative bold 45 comma I sub 4 equals the 4 by 4 matrix Row 1: Column 1, bold 1 Column 2, 0 Column 3, 0 Column 4, 0 Row 2: Column 1, 0 Column 2, bold 1 Column 3, 0 Column 4, 0 Row 3: Column 1, 0 Column 2, 0 Column 3, bold 1 Column 4, 0 Row 4: Column 1, 0 Column 2, 0 Column 3, 0 Column 4, bold 1

The zero matrix 0 sub 3 times 3 is diagonal, as the entries both above and below the main diagonal are 0: 0 sub 3 times 3 equals the 3 by 3 matrix Row 1: bold 0 0 0 Row 2: 0 bold 0 0 Row 3: 0 0 bold 0

Tip

You can define an n times n diagonal matrix A using the following: A equals open bracket a sub i j close bracket where a sub i j equals 0 for 1 is less than or equal to i is not equal to j is less than or equal to n period

Identity matrices

The final special kind of matrix is the idea of an identity matrix:

Note
Definition of the identity matrix I sub n

The n times n square matrix with all entries 1 on the main diagonal and 0’s everywhere else is called the n times n identity matrix I sub n.

You saw an example of an identity matrix in Example 5 (I sub 4). Here are two more examples I sub 2 equals the 2 by 2 matrix Row 1: 1 0 Row 2: 0 1 comma I sub 6 equals the 6 by 6 matrix Row 1: Column 1, 1 Column 2, 0 Column 3, 0 Column 4, 0 Column 5, 0 Column 6, 0 Row 2: Column 1, 0 Column 2, 1 Column 3, 0 Column 4, 0 Column 5, 0 Column 6, 0 Row 3: Column 1, 0 Column 2, 0 Column 3, 1 Column 4, 0 Column 5, 0 Column 6, 0 Row 4: Column 1, 0 Column 2, 0 Column 3, 0 Column 4, 1 Column 5, 0 Column 6, 0 Row 5: Column 1, 0 Column 2, 0 Column 3, 0 Column 4, 0 Column 5, 1 Column 6, 0 Row 6: Column 1, 0 Column 2, 0 Column 3, 0 Column 4, 0 Column 5, 0 Column 6, 1

Tip

The reason why identity matrices are called the identity matrices is because they act as ‘multiplicative identities’. See Guide: Matrix multiplication for more.

You can define an n times n identity matrix I sub n using the following: I sub n equals open bracket a sub i j close bracket where a sub i j equals 2 cases Case 1: 1 for 1 is less than or equal to i equals j is less than or equal to n Case 2: 0 for 1 is less than or equal to i is not equal to j is less than or equal to n period

Addition and subtraction with matrices

In this section, you will see when and how you can add and subtract matrices. The first thing to notice is the following.

Important

You can only add and subtract matrices if they share the same dimensions.

Note
Definition of matrix addition and subtraction

Let A and B be m times n matrices (so they have the same dimension). The matrix sum of A and B can be calculated by adding corresponding entries of A and B,

open paren A plus B close paren sub i j equals a sub i j plus b sub i j

Similarly, the matrix difference of A and B can be calculated by subtracting corresponding entries of A and B,

open paren A minus B close paren sub i j equals a sub i j minus b sub i j

Note
Example 4

Let A and B be the following two 2 times 2 matrices.

A equals the 2 by 2 matrix Row 1: 1 2 Row 2: 3 4 and B equals the 2 by 2 matrix Row 1: 5 6 Row 2: 7 8

The sum A plus B is:

A plus B equals the 2 by 2 matrix Row 1: Column 1, 1 plus 5 Column 2, 2 plus 6 Row 2: Column 1, 3 plus 7 Column 2, 4 plus 8 equals the 2 by 2 matrix Row 1: 6 8 Row 2: 10 12 The difference A minus B is:

A minus B equals the 2 by 2 matrix Row 1: Column 1, 1 minus 5 Column 2, 2 minus 6 Row 2: Column 1, 3 minus 7 Column 2, 4 minus 8 equals the 2 by 2 matrix Row 1: negative 4 negative 4 Row 2: negative 4 negative 4

Note
Example 5

Now let A and B be two 3 times 4 matrices.

A equals the 3 by 4 matrix Row 1: Column 1, 1 Column 2, negative 3 Column 3, 5 Column 4, negative 4 Row 2: Column 1, 3 Column 2, 0 Column 3, negative 2 Column 4, 2 Row 3: Column 1, negative 7 Column 2, 8 Column 3, 4 Column 4, 3 and B equals the 3 by 4 matrix Row 1: Column 1, negative 1 Column 2, 4 Column 3, 3 Column 4, negative 2 Row 2: Column 1, 2 Column 2, negative 3 Column 3, 0 Column 4, 1 Row 3: Column 1, negative 6 Column 2, negative 3 Column 3, 5 Column 4, 1 divided by 2

To subtract these matrices, you can subtract the corresponding elements:

A minus B equals the 3 by 4 matrix Row 1: Column 1, 1 minus negative 1 Column 2, negative 3 minus 4 Column 3, 5 minus 3 Column 4, negative 4 minus negative 2 Row 2: Column 1, 3 minus 2 Column 2, 0 minus 3 Column 3, negative 1 divided by 2 minus 0 Column 4, 2 minus 1 Row 3: Column 1, negative 7 minus negative 6 Column 2, 8 minus negative 3 Column 3, 4 minus 5 Column 4, 3 minus 1 divided by 2 Then you can simplify the signs, A minus B equals the 3 by 4 matrix Row 1: Column 1, 1 plus 1 Column 2, negative 3 minus 4 Column 3, 5 minus 3 Column 4, negative 4 plus 2 Row 2: Column 1, 3 minus 2 Column 2, 0 minus 3 Column 3, negative 1 divided by 2 Column 4, 2 minus 1 Row 3: Column 1, negative 7 plus 6 Column 2, 8 plus 3 Column 3, 4 minus 5 Column 4, 3 minus 1 divided by 2 equals the 3 by 4 matrix Row 1: Column 1, 2 Column 2, negative 7 Column 3, 2 Column 4, negative 2 Row 2: Column 1, 1 Column 2, negative 3 Column 3, negative 1 divided by 2 Column 4, 1 Row 3: Column 1, negative 1 Column 2, 11 Column 3, negative 1 Column 4, 5 divided by 2

You saw earlier that you can only add and subtract matrices if they share the same dimensions. You can look to this non-example to see why this is the case.

Note
Non-example

2 lines Line 1: A equals the 2 by 3 matrix Row 1: Column 1, 1 Column 2, 2 Column 3, negative 3 Row 2: Column 1, 4 divided by 5 Column 2, 0 Column 3, 6 open paren a 2 times 3 matrix close paren Line 2: B equals the 2 by 2 matrix Row 1: negative 8 8 Row 2: 0 11 open paren a 2 times 2 matrix close paren

Why can you not add A and B?

Matrix addition requires that each entry in one matrix corresponds to an entry in the other matrix. But, since:

Matrix A has dimensions 2 times 3, that is, 2 rows and 3 columns

Matrix B has dimensions 2 times 2, that is, 2 rows and 2 columns

they do not have the same dimensions. How you would attempt to calculate entries open paren A plus B close paren sub 13 and open paren B minus A close paren sub 23?

Scalar multiplication

Sometimes you can multiply a matrix by a number or variable. This is called scalar multiplication.

Note
Definition of scalar multipication with matrices

A scalar multiplication of a matrix A, by a number or variable k, is obtained by multiplying each entry in A by k,

k A equals open bracket k times a sub i j close bracket

You can now see a few examples of this.

Note
Example 6

Let’s multiply a 3 times 2 matrix by a scalar.

A equals the 3 by 2 matrix Row 1: Column 1, 0 Column 2, 4 divided by 3 Row 2: Column 1, negative 3 Column 2, the square root of 2 Row 3: Column 1, negative 7 Column 2, 12 k equals 3

To scalar multiply this matrix by 3, you multiply each element by 3:

3 A equals the 3 by 2 matrix Row 1: Column 1, 3 times 0 Column 2, 3 times 4 divided by 3 Row 2: Column 1, 3 times negative 3 Column 2, 3 times the square root of 2 Row 3: Column 1, 3 times negative 7 Column 2, 3 times 12 equals the 3 by 2 matrix Row 1: Column 1, 0 Column 2, 4 Row 2: Column 1, negative 9 Column 2, 3 the square root of 2 Row 3: Column 1, negative 21 Column 2, 36

To scalar multiply this matrix by x, you multiply each element by x: x A equals the 3 by 2 matrix Row 1: Column 1, 0 Column 2, 4 x Row 2: Column 1, negative 9 x Column 2, open paren 3 the square root of 2 close paren times x Row 3: Column 1, negative 21 x Column 2, 36 x

Note
Example 7

Let’s multiply a 1 times 4 matrix by a scalar.

A equals the 1 by 4 row matrix Column 1: negative 6 Column 2: 7 divided by 3 Column 3: pi Column 4: 12 k equals negative 1 divided by 2

To multiply this matrix by negative 1 divided by 2, you can multiply each element by negative 1 divided by 2:

negative one half A equals the 1 by 4 row matrix Column 1: negative one half times negative 6 Column 2: negative one half times 7 divided by 3 Column 3: negative one half times pi Column 4: negative one half times 12 equals the 1 by 4 row matrix Column 1: negative 3 Column 2: negative 7 divided by 6 Column 3: negative pi divided by 2 Column 4: negative 6

Now you can combine your understanding of matrix addition and scalar multiplication to tackle questions that ask for both of these skills.

Note
Example 8

Let’s calculate A plus 2 B, for A equals the 2 by 2 matrix Row 1: negative 2 3 Row 2: 0 1 B equals the 2 by 2 matrix Row 1: negative 1 2 Row 2: negative 1 negative 3

First, let’s work out 2 B, 2 B equals the 2 by 2 matrix Row 1: Column 1, 2 times negative 1 Column 2, 2 times 2 Row 2: Column 1, 2 times negative 1 Column 2, 2 times negative 3 By carrying out these multiplications, you can arrive at, 2 B equals the 2 by 2 matrix Row 1: Column 1, negative 2 Column 2, 4 Row 2: Column 1, negative 2 Column 2, negative 6 Now A plus 2 B, A plus 2 B equals the 2 by 2 matrix Row 1: Column 1, negative 1 plus negative 2 Column 2, 2 plus 4 Row 2: Column 1, negative 1 plus negative 2 Column 2, negative 3 plus negative 6 equals the 2 by 2 matrix Row 1: negative 3 6 Row 2: negative 3 negative 9

Tip

You can also multiply two matrices together; see Guide: Matrix multiplication for more.
