1.1.  If A = 8 and B = 10, what is angle a?   **Angle a = 38.7**$\degree$**(3sf)**

1.2.  If C = 8 and B = 4, what is angle b?    **Angle b = 30**$\degree$

1.3.  If A = 4 and C = 7, what is angle a?    **Angle a = 55.2**$\degree$**(3sf)**

1.4.  If angle a is 30$\degree$ and B = 6, what length is C?    **C = 12** 

1.5.  If angle b is 45$\degree$ and C = $2\sqrt{2}$, what length is A?    **A = 2** 

1.6.  If angle a is 15$\degree$ and C = 7, what length is A?    **A = 6.76 (3sf)** 

1.7.  If A = 8 and B = 6, what length is C?     **C = 10** 

1.8.  If A = 20 and B = 21, what length is C?    **C = 29** 

1.9.  If A = 8 and C = 17, what length is B?    **B = 15**
