# $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational

You can remember from [Overview: Number sets] that an irrational number is a number that cannot be represented as a fraction of integers, $p/q$ where $q \neq0$. Here you can prove that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. This particular proof dates back to the ancient Greeks and relies on a method of proof called **proof by contradiction**. In a proof by contradiction you begin by assuming that what you're trying to prove is false, then you show that from that assumption you can derive a contradiction, so your assumption must have been false.

Let's prove that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational by contradiction.

Suppose $\sqrt{2}$ is rational. Then it can be expressed as a fraction:

$$\sqrt{2} = p/q,$$

where $p$ and $q$ are integers with no common factors other than $1$, meaning the fraction is in its simplest form, and $q \neq 0$.

Then you can square both sides:
$$2 = {p^2}/{q^2},$$

and multiply both sides by $q^2$:
$$2q^2 = p^2.$$

This implies that $p^2$ is even (since it is divisible by $2$). Since the square of an odd number is odd, $p$ must be even. Let $p = 2k$ for some integer $k$.

You can then substitute $p = 2k$ into the equation:

$$2q^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2.$$

Dividing both sides by $2$:

$$q^2 = 2k^2.$$

This shows that $q^2$ is also even, which means $q$ must be even.

Since both $p$ and $q$ are even, they share a common factor of $2$, contradicting the assumption that $p$ and $q$ have no common factors other than $1$.

This contradiction implies that your initial assumption was false, $\sqrt{2}$ cannot be written as a fraction of integers, and so, $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.

# $\sqrt{p}$ is irrational

You can extend this proof to show that $\sqrt{p}$ is irrational for any prime $p$.

Suppose $\sqrt{p}$ is rational for some prime $p$. Then it can be expressed as a fraction:

$$\sqrt{p} = a/b,$$

where $a$ and $b$ are integers with no common factors other than $1$, meaning the fraction is in its simplest form, and $b \neq 0$.

Squaring both sides:
$$p = {a^2}/{b^2}.$$

Multiplying both sides by $b^2$:

$$pb^2 = a^2.$$

This implies that $a^2$ is divisible by $p$. So $a$ must also be divisible by $p$ (since $p$ is prime). Let $a = pk$ for some integer $k$.

Substituting into the equation:
$$pb^2 = (pk)^2 = p^2k^2.$$
Dividing both sides by $p$:
$$b^2 = pk^2.$$

This implies that $b^2$ is also divisible by $p$, so $b$ is divisible by $p$.

So, both $a$ and $b$ are divisible by $p$, contradicting the assumption that $a/b$ is in its simplest form.

Therefore, the assumption must be false, and $\sqrt{p}$ is irrational for any prime number $p$.
