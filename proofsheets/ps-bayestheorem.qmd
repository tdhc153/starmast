# Proof of the law of total probability

First of all, here is a restatement of the law of total probability from [Guide: Law of total probability and Bayes' theorem](../studyguides/bayestheorem.qmd):

## Definition of the law of total probability

Suppose an event $B$ depends on several possible scenarios. These scenarios can be described by events $A_1,A_2,\ldots, A_n$, that are:

* **Mutually exclusive**: they cannot occur at the same time, and
* **Exhaustive**: one of them must always occur.

Then, the **law of total probability** states that the probability of event $B$ is:

$$
\mathbb{P}(B) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb{P}(A_i) \mathbb{P}(B \mid A_i)
$$

:::

The proof of the law of total probability comes directly from the definition of conditional probability given in [Guide: Conditional probability](../studyguides/conditionalprobability.qmd):

$$
\mathbb{P}(B \mid A_i) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(B \cap A_i)}{\mathbb{P}(A_i)}
$$

Multiplying by $\mathbb{P}(A_i)$ gives the multiplication rule (again from [Guide: Conditional probability](../studyguides/conditionalprobability.qmd)) :

$$
\mathbb{P}(B \cap A_i) = \mathbb{P}(B \mid A_i) \mathbb{P}(A_i)
$$

As scenarios $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$ are mutually exclusive (so $A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset$ for all $1\leq i\neq j \leq n$) and exhaustive ($\bigcup_{1\leq i \leq n}A_i = B$), it follows from results in set theory (see [Guide: Operations on sets]) that:

$$
\mathbb{P}(B) = \mathbb{P}(B \cap A_1) + \mathbb{P}(B \cap A_2) + \dots + \mathbb{P}(B \cap A_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{P}(B \cap A_i)
$$

Substituting the above expressions gives:

$$
\mathbb{P}(B) = \mathbb{P}(B \mid A_1) \mathbb{P}(A_1) + \mathbb{P}(B \mid A_2) \mathbb{P}(A_2) + \dots + \mathbb{P}(B \mid A_n) \mathbb{P}(A_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{P}(B\mid A_i)\mathbb{P}(A_i)
$$

Which results in the law of total probability:

$$
\mathbb{P}(B) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb{P}(A_i) \mathbb{P}(B \mid A_i)
$$

# Proof of Bayes' theorem

Here is the statement of Bayes' theorem from [Guide: Law of total probability and Bayes' theorem](../studyguides/bayestheorem.qmd):

::: {.callout-note}
## Statement of Bayes' Theorem

If $A$ and $B$ are events with $\mathbb{P}(B) > 0$, then Bayes' Theorem states:

$$
\mathbb{P}(A \mid B) = \dfrac{\mathbb{P}(B \mid A) \mathbb{P}(A)}{\mathbb{P}(B)}.
$$

where:

* $\mathbb{P}(A \mid B)$ is the probability of $A$ given $B$,
* $\mathbb{P}(B \mid A)$ is the probability of $B$ given $A$,
* $\mathbb{P}(A)$ and $\mathbb{P}(B)$ are the individual probabilities of $A$ and $B$, respectively.

:::

Bayes' Theorem is derived directly from the definition of conditional probability: see [Guide: Conditional probability](../studyguides/conditionalprobability.qmd). Start with the conditional probabilities of two events $A$ and $B$:

$$
(1)\quad \mathbb{P}(A \mid B) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(A \cap B)}{\mathbb{P}(B)} \quad\textsf{ and }\quad (2)\quad \mathbb{P}(B \mid A) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(A \cap B)}{\mathbb{P}(A)}
$$

You can rearrange $(2)$ by multiplying both sides by $\mathbb{P}(A)$, giving the multiplication rule:

$$
\mathbb{P}(A \cap B) = \mathbb{P}(B \mid A) \mathbb{P}(A)
$$

Substitute this result into equation $(1)$ to get:

$$
\mathbb{P}(A \mid B) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(B \mid A) \mathbb{P}(A)}{\mathbb{P}(B)}
$$

This gives Bayesâ€™ Theorem, a way to reverse conditional probabilities when direct calculation is difficult.
