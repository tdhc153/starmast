# Video examples

This section will explain the style and formatting of how to create
video examples that should accompany examples within each study guide.
This will align with content within the STARMAST website. This section
is split into several parts.

-   Part A will explain how to download, and use, any needed software.
-   Part B will explain how to create a thumbnail using Canva.
-   Part C will explain how to record yourself talking through the
    example.
-   Part D will explain how to edit the video, using any needed
    software.

## Part A

This part explains how to create the written whiteboard/notepad section
of the video example. The aim is to produce a clean, accessible, and
consistent video that clearly presents worked mathematical examples in
the STARMAST visual style. In order to create a video example, you will
need to download one of the following notetaking / whiteboard apps onto
a tablet. You will require a stylus for handwritten work on the tablet.

-   Whiteboard by LiveBoard
-   Notability by Ginder Labs
-   Goodnotes by Goodnotes Limited

Open a new whiteboard. You will be using the following pen colours: \*
Black (for the worded part of the example question) \* Blue (for any
numerical values or equations) \* Red (for any comments or warnings)

Select your background colour as off-white (#FFFDF5)

Begin Recording your video. Write the example out clearly and in full.
Please remember: You will speed up/ slow down the video in editing, so it
is better to make the written work neat than to worry about timings.

Each finished whiteboard video should:

-   Be in landscape orientation (16:9).
-   Have neutral off-white background (hex #FFFDF5).
-   Use handwritten mathematical notation with consistent pen thickness
    and colour scheme.
-   Contain no interface buttons, pop-ups, or toolbars visible to the
    audience.
-   Include only the worked example - no visible face at this stage.
-   Be silent at this stage - face and voice recording will be added
    later in Part C.
-   Be exported in high-quality 1080p HD MP4 format.

You should write the example out clearly and in full. You should write
slowly and neatly. The speed of your writing can be adjusted later in
editing. Handwriting should be large enough so that it is readable on
smaller screens. Leave enough spacing between lines so that notation is
not crowded.

### Setting up in Whiteboard by LiveBoard

1.  **Download and install** the Whiteboard by LiveBoard app. It is
    available free on the App Store (iPad OS) and Google Play Store.
    Create your own account. You may be prompted to take out a trial
    version of the premium version of the app, however this is not
    necessary.

2.  **Create a new board** by tapping the "+ New Board" button at the
    bottom right. Choose Landscape orientation.

3.  **Setting the background**. This app doesn't allow custom background
    colours, so to add in the specific [#FFFDF5 background colour](Figures/fffdf5.png), insert this file as an image to your whiteboard and resize it so that it fills the entire canvas area.

## PART B

Open Canva and log in using the STARMAST credentials. Find the template
'Video Thumbnail' and edit the relevant information for your video.

Save the Thumbnail.

## PART C

To record yourself talking through the example you will need to download
the following: \* Teleprompter by Teleprompter App Limited

OR use Camera on your device.

Ensure you are in front of a plain, appropriate background. Ensure your
face is visible and your mouth is not covered.

Begin recording and talk through your example in line with the video you
created in Part A.

If necessary, use 'Voice Memos' to record an audio separately and then
record yourself lipsynching on Camera.

Next week:

-   Write part D for iMovie, Capcut, Shotcut.
-   In the meantime, we write dropdown sections (not in this qmd
    document though) about what is different in each of the three
    different notetaking/whiteboard apps.
