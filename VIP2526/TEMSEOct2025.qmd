## About me {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- Lecturer (Education Focused) at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews

- passionate about language and accessibility in mathematics and statistics

- enjoys cricket, coffee, and crosswords 

- contact me at tdhc@st-andrews.ac.uk

# Problem and proposed solution

## Problem {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

*need for accessible and inclusive maths/stats resources*

- **traditional textbooks** can be difficult to parse for non-specialists, technically inaccessible, expensive, intimidating...
    
- **diverse backgrounds**: every country has their own curriculum, language; Masters courses attract wide backgrounds of students...

- **lack of local support**: minimal central maths/stats support at institution

- **increased need for competency in maths/stats**

## Solution {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- creating a **free-to-use, high-quality bank of inclusive and technically accessible learning resources in mathematics and statistics, suitable for everyone** 
- in addition, **involving students** gives learners agency in their resource creation, teaches transferable skills not often found in maths and stats degrees, obtains diverse perspectives on learning...
    
- end product: [**STARMAST (starmast.org)**](https://starmast.org) - **St** **A**ndrews **R**esources in **Ma**thematics and **St**atistics

# Original vision for resources

## Original vision: inclusive {data-background-image="slides-bg.png" .smaller}

want materials to be **inclusive** of all learners

- strict guide on use of language ('you' not 'we', nothing easy, simple terms, minimal jargon, avoid context), emphasis on doing

    - [*polemic written*, inspired by British Dyslexic Association style guide](https://starmast.org/styleguide)
    
![List of banned words on starmast.org](temse-1.png)

## Original vision: accessibility {data-background-image="slides-bg.png" .smaller}

want to cater for wide range of learning styles, while retaining technical accessibility

- [**Quarto** is a typesetting system that outputs to html, pdf, docx from a **single content file**:](https://quarto.org/)

    - *accessible html, printable pdf, editable Word documents provided for all materials*
    
![Top of Guide: Arithmetic on complex numbers](temse-2.png)
    
## Original vision: freedom of use {data-background-image="slides-bg.png" .smaller}

want resources to be available anywhere at any time to anyone, with no cost (an **open educational resource**)

# Getting students involved part 1: STEP
    
## First go: STEP project {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

[Summer Teams Enterprise Programme](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/ceed/summer-enterprise-programme/)

- online programme over 7 weeks, 4-6 hours work each week
- reward is certificate on transcript
- teams of 6-7 students, with one paid graduate student acting as 'coach'
- students applied for programme overall, putting projects as first/second choice

## STARMAST STEP project {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- ran summer of 2023, aiming for release September 2023
- enough interest for two teams of 7 students each producing 12 guides between them, working in smaller teams or individually
    - topics included *rearranging equations, sigma notation, indices and logarithms, trigonometry, vectors*
- one graduate coach
- set up via github containing initial style guide, example guide, questions, answers

## Result {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

**partial success**

::::{.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}

**yes!**

- all requested resources created
- students satisfied with impactful work
- framework for expansion in place

**but**
    
- inconsistent quality, including plenty of banned words
- some parts missing
- some over-complications

## What went right? {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

::::{.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}

**for me**

- something to work with!
- plenty of questions and answers
- basis for expansion
- lots of student interest

:::

::: {.column width="5%"}

 

:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
    
**for students**

- important and impactful project
- good opportunity for transferable skills
- won something(?) at STEP awards

## What went wrong? {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

::::{.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}

**for me**

- no control over student selection
- disconnected from project
- dissatisfied with outputs, took time to put things right

:::

::: {.column width="5%"}

 

:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
    
**for students**

- little time to communicate with me
- long time to see publication (website published and made public May 2024)
- teamwork aspect diluted by online programme

# Getting students involved part 2: VIP

## Second go: VIP {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

[**V**ertically **I**ntegrated **P**roject:](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/education/vip/projects/)

- multi-year, multi-semester ongoing **research project** (with some leeway)

- students in **any year** can apply to **single projects**

- awards **module credits**, and students get a **grade** for their work

- allows students to **participate in the same project across multiple years**

## Our VIP {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- **small group, weekly meetings, hands-on supervisor involvement**

- **attracting wide range of students**

    - mathematicians, statisticians, economists, cell biologists, computer scientists, art historians...
    - from first-years to final years

- **assessment**: 20% fortnightly reflective logs, 30% posters and group presentation, 50% final portfolio and reflective report

## Why VIP improved on STEP {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

::::{.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}

**for me**

- full control over student selection
- collaboration with students, rather than sponsorship of students
- get to teach something out of my comfort zone :)

:::

::: {.column width="5%"}

 

:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
    
**for students**

- time to communicate with supervisor to float new ideas and understand minor project concerns
- module credits (as opposed to a certificate)
- chance to be part of a tight-knit team

:::

::::

## What could be better? {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- quality of written outputs can be inconsistent (but far *far* better than STEP project)

    - increased staff time for quality control

- potential duplication of assessment modes for returning students

- some student group friction (solution: team building in week 2)

## What's gone well? {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- time for project to breathe and for a team to form

- nature of VIP allows for development of big ideas across semesters and years

- excellent student buy-in to an impactful and meaningful project

- high student satisfaction, both with those who create the resources and those who **use** the resources

- good integration of interdisciplinary skills

- **outstanding range of outputs**

## VIP outputs from students {data-background-image="slides-bg.png" .smaller}

- **interactive figures:** using **Desmos API**, **R Shiny**, and (soon) **html** - leveraging generative AI to help

## VIP outputs from students {data-background-image="slides-bg.png" .smaller}

- **website backend**: domain name, security, search engine optimisation, hosting, custom website style, cookies, analytics, feedback boxes, emails, mailing list, progress trackers...

![Feedback box written by a second-year and final year student](temse-13.png){width="60%"}

# Now and next

## Now {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- resources used in three Schools in the University, with more to follow

- awareness of resources increasing due to promotion by student support services

    - supported by analytics data (129 new users in the past 30 days, compared to 374 all time since May 2024)
    
- students working on content for topics specifically requested by academic staff at St Andrews

- thinking about how best to present content

## Next (1/2) {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- **more content**

    - *50+ topics* hopefully by end of summer 2026 (and then more than that), videos, podcasts, more interactivity...

- **get the site out there!**

    - keep marketing inside and outside the University (emails to DoT's/student services, conferences, maths/stats support networks, schools, libraries...)

## Next (2/2) {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}
    
- **soon-ish**: reflective article on student involvement 

    - *Involving students in creating accessible mathematics and statistics support resources using a Vertically Integrated Project*, in preparation
    
- **way off in the distance**: research/education development leave for the project, measuring impact of resources, impact funding/case study

## How to keep in touch {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}
