## Introduction

Hello, and welcome to the VIP on 'Creating accessible online mathematics and statistics resources'!

My name is Tom and here are my contact details:

- Office location: Room 220, Mathematical Institute
- Email: tdhc@st-andrews.ac.uk

My office policy is open-door: if my door is open, please feel free to drop in!

<!-- The VIP has £400 budget, and students (that's you) can apply for more. All ideas for spend should come through me. -->

## Assessment pattern {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

This VIP has the following assessment pattern. 

- **Fortnightly reflective logs** in Weeks 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 (20%)
- **Group presentation at or close to the VIP conference**  (30%)
- **Portfolio of work and final report**, due **Saturday 1 May** (50%)

You will be assessed on the **20-point scale** for each of these components relative to your year. Your final grade will be the weighted average of all of these components. 

## Assessment: Fortnightly logs (1/2) {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

The deadline for each fortnightly log is **Friday 12 noon** in **odd numbered weeks**. Please **email these to me** before then. 

The Week 3 reflective log is **formative**, the rest are worth 5% of your module grade.

The word count is (30 words $\times$ number of credits taken).

I will be providing **formative feedback** after the **Week 3** and **Week 7** reflective logs.

## Assessment: Fortnightly logs (2/2) {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

Each fortnightly log will be rated on the **20-point scale**, with an average mark over the five fortnightly logs reported as your final mark for the 20%. **Only** the final grade (at the end of the semester) is needed to be made public. 

[I would suggest using Gibbs' reflective cycle to help structure your logs. Click this sentence to find out more.](https://reflection.ed.ac.uk/reflectors-toolkit/reflecting-on-experience/gibbs-reflective-cycle)

## Assessment: Group presentation (30%) {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

The group presentation will consist of **printed posters for the VIP conference** and an **oral presentation** (to be decided).

## Assessment: Portfolio and final report (50%) {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

The deadline for submission of the portfolio of works and final reflective report (100 words $\times$ amount of credits taken) is **Saturday 1 May**.

## Recent developments {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- [35 guides now available on 33 different topics, each with questions and answers, more to follow](https://starmast.org/studyguidelist)

- [Interactive factsheets on a variety of subjects](https://starmast.org/olist)

- [Blank 2D and 3D graphical calculators](https://starmast.org/applist)

- [presented website at local and national conferences](../externals.qmd)

- Resources being now being used in Maths and Stats, Chemistry, Earth and Environmental Sciences, and Medicine, and IELLI.

- over 750 users and 10000 page views last year (500 new users, 3500 page views last semester)

# What will you do? {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

## The tasks {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

**Create content**: study guides, questions, answers, proof sheets, fact sheets, general interest articles, interactive web content (flash cards, posters, etc), video and audio guides...

**Content management**: develop road-maps through the website, link with standard qualification materials, how best to present materials...

**Develop impact**: website management, workflow optimization, development and management of accessibility tools, social media strategies, outreach to the public, search engine optimization...

## Creating content {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- **Quality, not quantity.** Materials are going to be publicly available. *Only the best goes up.*

- **Follow the style guide to the letter.** The website *must* be written in a consistent style with the guides that are already there.

- The amount of work will vary on a sliding scale depending on your credits and year. You will write at least *one guide*, *one question set*, *one answer set*; discuss with Tom.

- Other than that, you can let your mind run free!

## Content management {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- How can we best present our resources?

- Match resources to school-level curricula and provide links for this

- Strategic priorities for the future

## Develop impact {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- Website management

- Accessibility research and development

- Outreach to the public

- Social media management

## How? {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

The website is written using Quarto (a markup language using R as a base), with version control using Github. You can use whichever code editor you so desire, but I strongly recommend using RStudio. Please make sure you download RStudio, R, and set up a github account.

The repository can be found at [https://github.com/tdhc153/starmast](https://github.com/tdhc153/starmast).

## Generative AI {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

This project allows the use of generative AI tools **only** in the creation of interactive figures.

It is **not** to be used in **any other aspect of your project work**. 

More resources about the use and misuse of generative AI can be found here:

## Schedule {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- Week 1: Today, task assignment

- Week 2: R/Quarto onboarding
