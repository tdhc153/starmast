## About me {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- Lecturer (Education Focused) at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews

- passionate about language and accessibility in mathematics and statistics

- enjoys cricket, coffee, and crosswords 

- contact me at tdhc@st-andrews.ac.uk

## Problem {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

*need for accessible and inclusive maths/stats resources*

- **traditional textbooks** can be difficult to parse for non-specialists, technically inaccessible, expensive, intimidating...
    
- **diverse backgrounds**: every country has their own curriculum, language; Masters courses attract wide backgrounds of students...

- **lack of local support**: minimal central maths/stats support at institution

- **increased need for competency in maths/stats**

## Solution {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- creating a **free-to-use, high-quality bank of inclusive and technically accessible learning resources in mathematics and statistics, suitable for everyone** 

    - in addition **involving students** gives learners agency in their resource creation, teaches transferable skills not often found in maths and stats degrees, obtains diverse perspectives on learning...
    
- end product: [**STARMAST (starmast.org)**](https://starmast.org) - **St** **A**ndrews **R**esources in **Ma**thematics and **St**atistics

## Resources (1/3) {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- **inclusive**: strict guide on use of language ('you' not 'we', nothing easy, simple terms, minimal jargon, avoid context), emphasis on doing

    - [*polemic written*](https://starmast.org/styleguide)
    - [*use of interactive figures provided by Desmos and R Shiny*](https://starmast.org/applist)

- **accessible**: available for use by all users

    - [*accessible html, printable pdf, editable Word documents provided for all guides via Quarto*](https://quarto.org/)
    - [*mp3 narrations provided for all guides*](https://starmast.org/news/bigupdate020725#audio-guides)
    
## Resources (2/3) {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- **free-to-use**: available anywhere at any time, with no cost (an *open educational resource*)

    - [*website, CC licensed*](https://starmast.org/license)

- **granular**: for each topic

    - [*study guide*: explains the key concepts, contains many examples (and usually interactive figures, Desmos/R Shiny), quick-check problems at the end](https://starmast.org/studyguides/introtoprobability)
    - [**question sheet**](https://starmast.org/questions/qs-introtoprobability) and [**answer sheet**](https://starmast.org/answers/as-introtoprobability)

    [other resources such as **fact, proof, overview** sheets](https://starmast.org/olist)
    
## Resources (3/3) {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- development in conjunction with educators across schools at the University of St Andrews:

    - (now) sent to incoming MSc Statistics students on conversion courses
    - (soon) will be provided as support resources for maths and stats in subjects such as chemistry, environmental sciences, medicine
    - (later) prioritisation of topics where support is most required (from manipulating fractions to multiple regression!)

## Mechanism: VIP (1/2) {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

[**V**ertically **I**ntegrated **P**roject:](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/education/vip/projects/)

- multi-year, multi-semester ongoing **research project** (with some leeway)

- students in **any year** can apply

- awards **module credits**, and students get a grade for their work

- allows students to **participate in the same project across multiple years**
    
## Mechanism: VIP (2/2) {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

our VIP:

- **small group, weekly meetings, hands-on supervisor involvement**

- **attracting wide range of students**

    - mathematicians, statisticians, economists, cell biologists, computer scientists, art historians...
    - from first-years to final years

- **assessment**: 20% fortnightly reflective logs, 30% posters and group presentation, 50% final portfolio and reflective report

## VIP outputs from students {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- **website backend**: domain name, security, search engine optimisation, hosting, custom website style, cookies, analytics, feedback boxes, emails, mailing list, progress trackers...

- **branding and marketing**: colour scheme, logo, outreach plans, social media, ads and posters...

- **accessibility work**: automatic narration of guides, interactive figures (flow-chart for hypothesis testing), built-in graphical calculators (desmos)...

- **content**: guides on algebra, geometry, calculus, stats...

## What's gone well? {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- outstanding range of outputs

- excellent student buy-in to an impactful and meaningful project

- high student satisfaction amongst enrolled students

- good integration of interdisciplinary skills
    
## What could be better? {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- quality of written outputs can be inconsistent

    - increased staff time for quality control

- potential duplication of assessment modes for returning students

- some student group friction

## Future plans (1/2) {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- **more content**

    - *50+ topics* hopefully by end of summer 2026 (and then more than that), videos, podcasts, more interactivity...

- **get the site out there!**

    - market inside and outside the University (emails to DoT's/student services, conferences, maths/stats support networks, schools, libraries...)

## Future plans (2/2) {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}
    
- **soon-ish**: reflective article on student involvement 

    - *Involving students in creating accessible mathematics and statistics support resources via a Vertically Integrated Project*, in preparation
    
- **way off in the distance**: research/education development leave for the project, measuring impact of resources, impact funding/case study
