    "text": "What is sigma notation?\nIf you want to add infinitely many things together, then it would be nice to have a quick way of writing this down! This is where sigma notation comes in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of sum and sigma notation\n\n\n\nA sum is any addition of two or more real numbers. If \\(a_k,a_{k+1}, \\ldots, a_n\\) are real numbers (where \\(k\\) and \\(n\\) are some natural numbers with \\(k\\leq N\\)), then you can use sigma notation to write their sum as \\[a_k + a_{k+1} + \\ldots + a_N = \\sum_{i = k}^N a_i\\] where the right hand side reads ‘the sum from \\(i = k\\) to \\(i = n\\) of the elements \\(a_i\\)’. The symbol \\(i\\) is known as the index of the sum; the index of a sum can notionally be any letter.\n\n\n\nExamples\nHere’s some examples of sigma notation.\n\nWhat is the value of \\(\\displaystyle\\sum_{n=2}^5 n^2\\)?\nBefore tackling a problem using sigma notation, it can be best to read it out loud. Here, \\[\\sum_{n=2}^5 n^2\\textsf{ is 'the sum from $n = 2$ to $n = 5$ of $n^2$'.}\\] This translates to \\[\\sum_{n=2}^5 n^2 = 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2\\] and \\(2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 = 54\\).\nWhat is the value of \\(\\displaystyle\\sum_{n=1}^N n = S\\)?\n\nIn this case, you’re being asked to find \\(S = 1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + N\\). The following method is due to Gauss, who came up with this answer during a maths lesson at school when he was seven (hinting at the genius to follow).\nFirst of all, you can reorder \\(S\\) to write that \\(S = N + (N-1) + \\ldots + 2 + 1\\). Adding two lots of \\(S\\) together gives the following:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccccccccccc}\n& S & = & 1 & + & 2 & + & 3 & + & \\ldots & + & N \\\\\n+ & S & = & N & + & (N-1) & + & (N-2) & + & \\ldots & + & 1\\\\\\hline\n& 2S & = & (N+1) & + & (N+1) & + & (N+1) & + & \\ldots & + & (N+1)\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nTherefore, \\(2S\\) is \\(N\\) lots of \\((N+1)\\); you can write this as \\(2S = N(N+1)\\). Dividing both sides by \\(2\\) gives \\(S = N(N+1)/2\\)."

    "text": "Using the quadratic formula\nHere are some examples of quadratic equations which are solved using the quadratic formula. To do this, you need to be able to identify the variable and the coefficients \\(a,b,c\\).\nThe first of these examples illustrates the importance of making sure the correct signs are inputted into the quadratic formula.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n\nWhat are the roots of the quadratic equation \\(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\\)?\nHere, you could factorise the quadratic equation \\(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\\) to get \\((x-2)(x-3) = 0\\). This is zero precisely when \\(x - 2 = 0\\) or \\(x - 3 = 0\\); so the roots are \\(x = 2\\) and \\(x = 3\\).\nYou can also work this out using the quadratic formula. In this case, you’ll need to identify the values of \\(a,b,c\\) in the equation \\(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\\); here, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -5\\) and \\(c = 6\\). Taking care of the signs, you can put these into the quadratic formula and simplify to get\n\\[ x = \\frac{-(-5) \\pm \\sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4(1)(6)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 - 24}}{2} = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{1}}{2} = \\frac{5\\pm 1}{2}\\]\nTherefore, the roots are \\(x = 4/2 = 2\\) and \\(x = 6/2 = 3\\), as was found above.\n\n\nThis next example illustrates the importance of the quadratic equation having \\(0\\) on one side in order to find the roots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\n\nWhat are the roots of the quadratic equation \\(-8x - 8 = x^2 + 8\\)?\nIn order to use the quadratic formula, you need to first put the equation into the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\). So rearranging \\(-8x - 8 = x^2 + 8\\) to get zero on the left hand side gives\n\\[0 = x^2 + 8x + 16\\]\nSo in this case, you can take \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 8\\) and \\(c = 16\\) and put these in the quadratic formula to get\n\\[ x = \\frac{-(8) \\pm \\sqrt{(8)^2 - 4(1)(16)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{2} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2} = \\frac{-8}{2}\\]\nIn this case, the discriminant \\(D = 0\\) and so there is one distinct root that must be counted twice. Therefore, the roots are \\(x = -8/2 = -4\\) twice.\n\n\nThis next example is the first where \\(a \\neq 1\\); you should be prepared to solve any quadratic equation in the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\n\nWhat are the roots of the quadratic equation \\(4x^2 + 4x + 5 = 0\\)?\nThis equation is already in the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), with \\(a = 4\\), \\(b = 4\\) and \\(c = 5\\). Putting these into the quadratic formula gives\n\\[ x = \\frac{-(4) \\pm \\sqrt{(4)^2 - 4(4)(5)}}{2(4)} = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 80}}{8} = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{-64}}{8}\\]\nIn this case, the discriminant \\(D < 0\\). You can say that \\(\\sqrt{-64} = 8i\\), as \\(8\\) is the square root of \\(64\\) and \\(i\\) is the square root of \\(-1\\). This means that\n\\[x = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{-64}}{8} = \\frac{-4 \\pm 8i}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}\\pm i\\]\nand these are the two roots of this quadratic equation.\n\n\nThe next example changes the name of the variable used. You should be able to recognise a quadratic equation in the wild, regardless of what symbol is used as the variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\n\nWhat are the roots of the quadratic equation \\(m^2 - m - 1 = 0\\)?\nHere, the quadratic equation is of the required form \\(am^2 + bm + c = 0\\) with \\(a = 1, b = -1\\) and \\(c = -1\\). Putting these into the quadratic formula gives:\n\\[ m = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - (-4)}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\]\nTherefore, the two roots of the quadratic equation are \\(m = (1 -\\sqrt{5})/2\\) and \\(m = (1 + \\sqrt{5})/2\\). (The second of these is a well-known mathematical constant known as the golden ratio)\n\n\nThe final two examples deal with changes of variable and also a change in the typical structure of a quadratic equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\n\nWhat are the roots of the equation \\(y^4 - 3y^2 + 2 =0\\)?\nYou can notice here that the equation given is not strictly a quadratic equation, as it is not of the form given in the definition above. However, by taking \\(y^2\\) as the variable instead of \\(y\\), you can rewrite this equation as\n\\[y^4 - 3y^2 + 2 = (y^2)^2 - 3y^2 + 2 = 0\\]\nand so this is a quadratic equation, with \\(y^2\\) as the variable. You can then use the quadratic formula with \\(y^2\\) as the variable, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -3\\) and \\(c = 2\\) to get\n\\[ y^2 = \\frac{-(-3) \\pm \\sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(1)(2)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 - 8}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\pm 1}{2}\\]\nTherefore, the two solutions for \\(y^2\\) are \\(y^2 = 2/2 = 1\\) and \\(y^2 = 4/2 = 2\\). This gives four solutions for \\(y\\), which are \\(y = 1, -1, \\sqrt{2}, -\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\n\nWhat are the solutions to the equation \\(4q - 13 = -3/q\\)?\nYou can notice here that this equation does not look like a quadratic equation at all; so some rearranging needs to be done. First of all, you can multiply both sides by \\(q\\) to get\n\\[4q^2 - 13q = -3\\]\nand so\n\\[4q^2 - 13q + 3 = 0\\]\nSo this really was a quadratic equation, with \\(a = 4\\), \\(b = -13\\) and \\(c = 3\\). Putting this into the quadratic formula gives \\[\\begin{align*}\nq &= \\frac{-(-13) \\pm \\sqrt{(-13)^2 - 4(4)(3)}}{2(4)} = \\frac{13 \\pm \\sqrt{169 - 48}}{8}\\\\[1em]\n&= \\frac{13 \\pm \\sqrt{121}}{8} = \\frac{13 \\pm 11}{8}\n\\end{align*}\\] Therefore, the two solutions to the equation are \\(q = 2/8 = 1/4\\) and \\(q = 24/8 = 3\\)."

    "section": "What is a quadratic equation?",
    "text": "What is a quadratic equation?\nOne of the most important types of an equation are quadratic equations; very generally speaking, these are equations that contain a squared term. These appear almost everywhere in mathematics, from modelling projectile motion in mechanics to describing circles, ellipses, parabolas and hyperbolas in 2D space. It is therefore crucial to be able to identify and solve quadratic equations.\nThis guide will focus quadratic equations in one variable, explain the shape of their graphs, and explains how to identify the variable and the coefficients of the equation. Then, the discriminant is defined, and the role of the discriminant in determining solutions to the quadratic equation is explained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of quadratic equation, root\n\n\n\nA quadratic equation is an equation that can be rearranged into the form \\[ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\] where \\(x\\) is a variable and \\(a,b,c\\) are real numbers with \\(a \\neq 0\\).\nValues of \\(x\\) that satisfy the equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) are known as roots of the equation. Typically, roots of a quadratic are expressed in the form of the variable. So here, the roots of \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) are ‘roots in \\(x\\)’.\n\n\nHere, \\(a\\neq 0\\) as if it was, then the equation would no longer be a quadratic equation!\nThe general shape of a quadratic equation is known as a parabola. A figure of two parabolas is given in Figure 1; the left hand graph is if \\(a > 0\\), whereas the right hand graph is when \\(a < 0\\).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A pair of parabolas. (left) A graph of a quadratic \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) where \\(a > 0\\). (right) A graph of a quadratic \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) where \\(a < 0\\).\n\n\n\nIt is very important to be able to identify the variable in a quadratic equation, as well as the coefficients \\(a,b,c\\). In the course of your mathematical study, it may be that the variable of a quadratic equation is not only letters like \\(x,y,z\\), but squares or cubes like \\(x^2\\) and \\(y^3\\), or even functions like \\(e^x\\), \\(\\cos(x)\\), and \\(\\sin(y)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n\nYou are given the quadratic equation \\(2x^2 + 4x - 8 = 0\\). The variable of the quadratic equation is \\(x\\), and the coefficients are \\(a = 2, b = 4, c = -8\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\n\nHere, the equation \\(y^4 - 10y^2 + 25 = 0\\) may look like a quartic equation, but it is actually a quadratic equation. Using the laws of indices, you can rewrite the equation as \\((y^2)^2 - 10y^2 + 25 = 0\\). Therefore, the variable of the quadratic equation is \\(y^2\\), and the coefficients are \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -10\\), \\(c = 25\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\n\nYou are given the equation \\(-e^{2x} + 4e^{x} - 5 = 0\\). Using the laws of indices, you can rewrite the equation as \\(-(e^{x})^2 + 4e^x - 5 = 0\\). The variable of the quadratic equation is \\(e^x\\), and the coefficients are \\(a = -1\\), \\(b = 4\\), \\(c = -5\\). This is not the only solution to the coefficients; you can multiply the equation through by \\(-1\\) to get \\((e^{x})^2 - 4e^x + 5 = 0\\), which gives \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -4\\) and \\(c = 5\\). Both solutions are equally valid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\n\nYou are given the equation \\(t+1 = \\frac{4}{t-3}\\). This really is a quadratic equation! You can multiply both sides by \\(x - 3\\) to get \\[(t+1)(t+3) = 4\\] You can then expand the brackets to get \\[t^2 + t + 3t + 3 = 4\\] and so \\(t^2 + 4t + 3 = 4\\). Finally, you are able to subtract \\(4\\) from both sides to get \\(t^2 + 4t - 1 = 0\\). It follows that the variable of the quadratic equation is \\(t\\), and the coefficients are \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 4\\), \\(c = -1\\)."

See (Guide: Factorisation) for more.\nYou could complete the square in order to reduce the quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) into the form \\((x + b/2a)^2 = d\\), and then solve from there (not forgetting the negative root). See (Guide: Completing the square) for more.\nYou could use the quadratic formula; for a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the two roots to the quadratic equation are given by \\[x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.\\]\n\nEach method is equally valid, but some may involve more work than others.

You can observe this behaviour on a graph in Figure 2; the parabola crosses the \\(x\\)-axis in two places.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A pair of parabolas. (left) A graph of a quadratic \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) where \\(a > 0\\) and \\(D > 0\\). (right) A graph of a quadratic \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) where \\(a < 0\\) and \\(D > 0\\).\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(D = b^2 - 4ac = 0\\) is zero, then \\(\\sqrt{D} = 0\\). In this case, the two roots of the quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) are \\[x = \\frac{-b}{2a} \\qquad\\textsf{ and }\\qquad x = \\frac{-b}{2a}\\] These two roots are given by the same real number. To be sure that you express both roots, you can write ‘\\(x = -b/2a\\) twice’. You can observe this behaviour on a graph in Figure 3; the parabola touches the \\(x\\)-axis in exactly one place.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: A pair of parabolas. (left) A graph of a quadratic \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) where \\(a > 0\\) and \\(D = 0\\). (right) A graph of a quadratic \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) where \\(a < 0\\) and \\(D = 0\\).\n\n\n\n\nIf \\(D = b^2 - 4ac\\) is negative, then \\(\\sqrt{D}\\) is not a real number. In this case, the two roots of the quadratic equation are complex numbers. You can express the two roots of the quadratic equation by \\[x = \\frac{-b + i\\sqrt{-D}}{2a}\\qquad\\textsf{ and }\\qquad x = \\frac{-b - i\\sqrt{-D}}{2a}\\] where \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit (so \\(i^2 = -1\\); see (Guide: Introduction to complex numbers)). In a graph, the parabola does not cross the \\(x\\)-axis at all; this indicates that there are no real solutions to this quadratic equation. See Figure 4 for a picture.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: A pair of parabolas. (left) A graph of a quadratic \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) where \\(a > 0\\) and \\(D > 0\\). (right) A graph of a quadratic \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) where \\(a < 0\\) and \\(D < 0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou can use the discriminant to check how many roots a quadratic equation has in the variable given to you. However, this is at most a maximum number of solutions. Conditions on that variable may also reduce the number of valid solutions, particularly if you have real valued functions. For instance, since \\(e^x > 0\\) for all real number \\(x\\), there are no solutions in \\(x\\) if you find \\(e^x = -1\\).\n\n\nHere’s some examples of using the discriminant and known properties of functions to rule out solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\n\nIn Example 1, you identified the coefficients of \\(2x^2 + 4x - 8 = 0\\) as \\(a = 2, b = 4, c = -8\\). Using these, you can work out the value of the discriminant \\(D = b^2 - 4ac\\) as \\[D = (4)^2 - 4(2)(-8) = 16 + 64 = 80.\\] Since \\(D = 80\\), you can say that this quadratic equation has two distinct real roots in \\(x = r_1\\) and \\(x = r_2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\n\nIn Example 2, you identified the coefficients of \\(y^4 - 10y^2 + 25 = 0\\) as \\(a = 1, b = -10, c = 25\\), and the variable as \\(y^2\\). Using these, you can work out the value of the discriminant \\(D = b^2 - 4ac\\) as \\[D = (-10)^2 - 4(1)(25) = 100 - 100 = 0.\\] Since \\(D = 0\\), you can say that this quadratic equation has at most one real root \\(r\\) in terms of \\(y^2\\).\nWhether or not the equation itself has real solutions in \\(y\\) depends on whether \\(r\\) is positive or negative! You cannot take the square root of a negative number, so if \\(r\\) is negative the equation has no real solutions. If \\(r\\) is positive, then the equation has two real roots in \\(y\\); that is, \\(y = \\pm\\sqrt{r}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\n\nIn Example 3, you identified the coefficients of \\(-e^{2x} + 4e^{x} - 5 = 0\\) as \\(a = -1, b = 4, c = -5\\), and the variable as \\(e^{x}\\). Using these, you can work out the value of the discriminant \\(D = b^2 - 4ac\\) as \\[D = (4)^2 - 4(-1)(-5) = 16 - 20 = -4.\\] Since \\(D = -4\\), you can say that this quadratic equation has complex roots.\nThis equation therefore has no real solutions in \\(x\\). This is because \\(e^x\\) is real for any real \\(x\\); if \\(e^x\\) is complex, it follows that \\(x\\) cannot be real.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\n\nIn Example 4, you rearranged the equation \\(t+1 = \\frac{4}{t-3}\\) to \\(t^2 + 4t - 1 = 0\\), and therefore identified the coefficients as \\(a = 1, b = 4, c = -1\\), and the variable as \\(t\\). Using these, you can work out the value of the discriminant \\(D = b^2 - 4ac\\) as \\[D = (4)^2 - 4(1)(-1) = 16 + 4 = 20.\\] Since \\(D = 20\\), you can say that this quadratic equation has two distinct real roots in \\(t\\)."

    "text": "Trigonometric equations which use identities\nThe majority of trigonometric equations will make use of trigonometric identities (See the guide for a list of those). For example, if you see an equation you want to solve which includes a mixture of sin, cos, tan etc, identities should be the first place you look in order to solve it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\n\nLet’s start with the equation\n\\[4\\cos^{2}(x)+6\\sin^{2}(x)-6=0\\]\nInitially, you can’t solve this equation using the methods described above. This is where trigonometric identities play an important role. This equation can be solved using the fact that \\(\\cos^{2}(x)+\\sin^2(x)=1\\). The way that you know to use this identity is that the equation involves \\(\\cos^2(x)\\) and \\(\\sin^2(x)\\).\nFirstly, lets rewrite as \\(4\\cos^2(x)+4\\sin^2(x)+2\\sin^2(x)-6=0\\) and from there, \\(4(\\cos^2(x)+\\sin^2(x))+2\\sin^2(x)-6=0\\). Then, use the identity to say that \\(4(1)+2\\sin^2(x)-6=0\\).\nYou can then move the constants to the left hand side and say that \\(2\\sin^2(x)= 2\\), or \\(\\sin^2(x)=1\\). Remember that \\(\\sin^2(x)= {\\sin(x)}^2\\)\nNote that this is NOT the case for \\(\\sin^{-1}(x)\\), as that is describing the inverse of a function, not raising to the power of -1.\nUsing that, you can rewrite this as \\(\\sin(x)=\\sqrt{1}=1\\). Then, find the inverse sin \\(\\sin^{-1}(1)=\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\n\nProve that \\(4\\sec^2(x)+3= 4\\tan^2(x)+7\\).\nTo prove this you use the identity \\(\\sec^2(x)=\\tan^2(x)+1\\). You can work from either side, but I find it easier to replace \\(\\sec^2(x)\\), giving the equation \\(4(\\tan^2(x)+1)+3\\) on the left hand side. Now, expanding the brackets should give your final answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\n\nTrigonometric identities aren’t mutually exclusive. For example, you can use that \\(\\sec^2(x)=1+\\tan^2(x)\\) to prove that \\(\\cos^2(x)+\\sin^2(x)=1\\).\nFirstly, rewrite \\(\\sec^2(x)\\) and \\(\\tan^2(x)\\) in terms of \\(\\cos(x)\\) and \\(\\sin(x)\\). This gives the equation \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos^2(x)}= 1 + \\frac{\\sin^2(x)}{\\cos^2(x)}\\).\nNow, you can rewrite 1 as \\(\\frac{\\cos^2(x)}{\\cos^2(x)}\\), and get that \\(\\frac{1}{\\cos^2(x)}=\\frac{\\cos^2(x)+\\sin^2(x)}{\\cos^2(x)}\\).\nFinally, multiplying both sides by \\(\\cos^2(x)\\) will leave your identity: \\(1= \\cos^2(x)+\\sin^2(x)\\)"

    "text": "Trigonometric equations\nThe first instance of trigonometric equations you will probably come across will be in the form \\(\\cos(x)=\\) a constant and you want to find the angle x.\nLet’s take \\(\\cos(x)=0.15\\) for an example. This can be done by using your calculator to find \\(\\cos^{-1}(0.15)\\).\nThese are one step problems, and you will normally have a calculator to solve them.\nIf not, it’s likely the angle has a commonly known value, for example \\(\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2})=0\\). A table of these known values is given in the guide on Trigonometry.\nAn important factor to note is that throughout this guide, you will be finding a correct answer, not the correct answer. This is due to the periodic nature of trigonometric functions (thinking of the graph can help visualise this- if you draw a horizontal line across the graph, it will cross more than once!),\nThere are infinite answers to trigonometric equations. The way you can find the other answers is by adding or subtracting \\(2\\pi\\) radians or 360 degrees (or an integer multiple of) from your answer.\nThe next set of trigonometric equations you are likely to find are in a similar format. This time, however, instead of just x there would be an equation involving x. To solve this, you would solve as the first method, then set that equal to your equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n\nLets say you want to solve \\[\\cos(3x+15)=0.5\\]\nA good first step is to rename \\(3x+15\\) to \\(y\\). Then, you have a familiar equation \\(\\cos(y)=0.5\\). You can rearrange this to \\(\\cos^{-1}(0.5)=y\\), which gives \\(y=\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\)\nFrom there, you can see that \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}=3x+15\\) from the definition of \\(y\\). Please note, I’ve added in the step of naming y as I find it easier to comprehend, but if you want to use \\(3x+15\\) the whole time, that is also a valid method.\nYou can factorise the left hand side to get \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}= 3(x+5)\\). Then you can divide both sides of the equation by 3, so that you now have x with no prefix, giving \\(\\frac{\\pi}{9}= x+5\\).\nAfter this, subtract 5 from both sides to isolate x: \\(\\frac{\\pi}{9}-5 =x\\). In some cases that will be an appropriate answer (for example in maths or this exercise), other times you may want to give a number (like if you are solving a physics problem). In this case \\(x= -4.65\\) to 3 significant figures.\nThis example has a linear equation inside the trigonometric function, but you would follow the same steps for a quadratic equation in the function. In that case, you would just be solving where your value for \\(y\\) is equal to a quadratic equation, using the methods enclosed in the guide on Quadratic equations."

If you use the format above, you can label a=5, b=25, and c=x. Then, you would rewrite in the form \\(\\log_a{b}=\\log_5{25}=x\\), giving \\(x=2\\). This is commonly phrased as asking a question about modelling some form of exponential growth.\nAnother type may be to have an equation inside the logarithm. Lets take a look at an example to explain this one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\n\n\\[\\log_{10}(5x+7)=1\\]\nYou want to find x. Using the tip from above, you can rewrite this as: \\(10^1=5x+7\\). From there, you can subtract 7 from both sides, giving \\(3=5x\\) and then divide both sides by 5, giving \\(x=\\frac{3}{5}\\).\n\n\nYou may also come across equations which are similar to the one above, but cleverly hidden through logarithm rules. Lets go through one of those.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\n\n\\[\\log_{10}(4x)-\\log_{10}(3)=2\\]\nFind x.\nYou start by rewriting the left hand side of the equation into one logarithm. The guide on logarithms should have a section on this. This will give you \\(\\log_{10}(\\frac{4x}{3})=2\\).\nNow, you should rewrite this as an exponential to get \\(10^2= \\frac{4x}{3}\\). To finish solving, you will divide both sides by \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\). This gives that \\(x=75\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\n\nHere’s a little example/proof which should help to understand the next example more completely.\nLets have a look at an equation where a number is raised to the power of a logarithm in its own base.\n\\[e^{\\log_e(x)}=y\\] Find y in terms of x.\nFirstly, label up the equation according to the note at the start of this. This gives a=e, b=y, c=\\(\\log_e(x)\\). From there, rewrite the equation as a logarithm, \\(\\log_e(y)=\\log_e(x)\\). This means that \\(y=x\\). We can say this for a log function but not for, lets say, a trigonometric function, as log functions don’t have repeating values.\nOn a wider scale, this proves that \\[a^{\\log_a(b)}=b\\]. Whilst e was the base used in this example, it doesn’t affect the outcome. You can repeat this exercise with a base of 2 if you would like to confirm.\n\n\nAnother use of logarithms is in solving simultaneous equations. This takes advantage of the relationship between logarithms and exponentials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\n\nSolve this set of simultaneous equations\n\\[e^y=2x+1\\]\n\\[\\ln(3x)=y\\]\nThe first step for this problem would to be to substitute \\(y=\\ln(3x)\\) into the first equation. This gives \\(e^{\\ln(3x)}=2x+1\\). Now, lets label: a=e, b=2x+1 and c=\\(\\ln(3x)\\).\nThus, refer to our example 7 to see that \\(3x=2x+1\\). Subtracting 2x from either side gives that \\(x=1\\). Substituting this back into our equation gives that \\(y=\\ln(3)\\) or approximately 1.099.\n\n\nAnother example of the relationship between logarithms and exponentials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 9\n\n\n\nSolve \\[5e^{-x}+3e^x=9\\]\nTo start with this problem, you should multiply everything by \\(e^x\\), giving \\(5+3e^{2x}=9e^x\\).\nLets rename \\(e^x=y\\), which should hopefully give a more familiar equation: \\(5+3y^2=9y\\). You can rearrange and solve this quadratic using the quadratic equation. This gives y=\\(\\frac{9+\\sqrt{21}}{16}\\) or \\(\\frac{9-\\sqrt{21}}{16}\\).\n\\(e^x=y\\) implies that \\(\\ln(y)=x\\), so you substitute y into this equation to give your final answer. This leaves you with x=\\(\\ln{(\\frac{9+\\sqrt{21}}{16})}\\) or \\(\\ln{(\\frac{9-\\sqrt{21}}{16})}\\), which are (to 3sf) -0.164 and -1.29 respectively."
