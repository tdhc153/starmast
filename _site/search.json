    "text": "What is sigma notation?\nIf you want to add infinitely many things together, then it would be nice to have a quick way of writing this down! This is where sigma notation comes in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of sum and sigma notation\n\n\n\nA sum is any addition of two or more real numbers. If \\(a_k,a_{k+1}, \\ldots, a_n\\) are real numbers (where \\(k\\) and \\(n\\) are some natural numbers with \\(k\\leq N\\)), then you can use sigma notation to write their sum as \\[a_k + a_{k+1} + \\ldots + a_N = \\sum_{i = k}^N a_i\\] where the right hand side reads ‘the sum from \\(i = k\\) to \\(i = n\\) of the elements \\(a_i\\)’. The symbol \\(i\\) is known as the index of the sum; the index of a sum can notionally be any letter.\n\n\n\nExamples\nHere’s some examples of sigma notation.\n\nWhat is the value of \\(\\displaystyle\\sum_{n=2}^5 n^2\\)?\nBefore tackling a problem using sigma notation, it can be best to read it out loud. Here, \\[\\sum_{n=2}^5 n^2\\textsf{ is 'the sum from $n = 2$ to $n = 5$ of $n^2$'.}\\] This translates to \\[\\sum_{n=2}^5 n^2 = 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2\\] and \\(2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 = 54\\).\nWhat is the value of \\(\\displaystyle\\sum_{n=1}^N n = S\\)?\n\nIn this case, you’re being asked to find \\(S = 1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + N\\). The following method is due to Gauss, who came up with this answer during a maths lesson at school when he was seven (hinting at the genius to follow).\nFirst of all, you can reorder \\(S\\) to write that \\(S = N + (N-1) + \\ldots + 2 + 1\\). Adding two lots of \\(S\\) together gives the following:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccccccccccc}\n& S & = & 1 & + & 2 & + & 3 & + & \\ldots & + & N \\\\\n+ & S & = & N & + & (N-1) & + & (N-2) & + & \\ldots & + & 1\\\\\\hline\n& 2S & = & (N+1) & + & (N+1) & + & (N+1) & + & \\ldots & + & (N+1)\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nTherefore, \\(2S\\) is \\(N\\) lots of \\((N+1)\\); you can write this as \\(2S = N(N+1)\\). Dividing both sides by \\(2\\) gives \\(S = N(N+1)/2\\)."

    "text": "Using the quadratic formula\nHere are some examples of quadratic equations which are solved using the quadratic formula. To do this, you need to be able to identify the variable and the coefficients \\(a,b,c\\).\nThe first of these examples illustrates the importance of making sure the correct signs are inputted into the quadratic formula.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n\nWhat are the roots of the quadratic equation \\(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\\)?\nHere, you could factorise the quadratic equation \\(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\\) to get \\((x-2)(x-3) = 0\\). This is zero precisely when \\(x - 2 = 0\\) or \\(x - 3 = 0\\); so the roots are \\(x = 2\\) and \\(x = 3\\).\nYou can also work this out using the quadratic formula. In this case, you’ll need to identify the values of \\(a,b,c\\) in the equation \\(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\\); here, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -5\\) and \\(c = 6\\). Taking care of the signs, you can put these into the quadratic formula and simplify to get\n\\[ x = \\frac{-(-5) \\pm \\sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4(1)(6)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{25 - 24}}{2} = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{1}}{2} = \\frac{5\\pm 1}{2}\\]\nTherefore, the roots are \\(x = 4/2 = 2\\) and \\(x = 6/2 = 3\\), as was found above.\n\n\nThis next example illustrates the importance of the quadratic equation having \\(0\\) on one side in order to find the roots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\n\nWhat are the roots of the quadratic equation \\(-8x - 8 = x^2 + 8\\)?\nIn order to use the quadratic formula, you need to first put the equation into the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\). So rearranging \\(-8x - 8 = x^2 + 8\\) to get zero on the left hand side gives\n\\[0 = x^2 + 8x + 16\\]\nSo in this case, you can take \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 8\\) and \\(c = 16\\) and put these in the quadratic formula to get\n\\[ x = \\frac{-(8) \\pm \\sqrt{(8)^2 - 4(1)(16)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 64}}{2} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{0}}{2} = \\frac{-8}{2}\\]\nIn this case, the discriminant \\(D = 0\\) and so there is one distinct root that must be counted twice. Therefore, the roots are \\(x = -8/2 = -4\\) twice.\n\n\nThis next example is the first where \\(a \\neq 1\\); you should be prepared to solve any quadratic equation in the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\n\nWhat are the roots of the quadratic equation \\(4x^2 + 4x + 5 = 0\\)?\nThis equation is already in the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), with \\(a = 4\\), \\(b = 4\\) and \\(c = 5\\). Putting these into the quadratic formula gives\n\\[ x = \\frac{-(4) \\pm \\sqrt{(4)^2 - 4(4)(5)}}{2(4)} = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 80}}{8} = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{-64}}{8}\\]\nIn this case, the discriminant \\(D < 0\\). You can say that \\(\\sqrt{-64} = 8i\\), as \\(8\\) is the square root of \\(64\\) and \\(i\\) is the square root of \\(-1\\). This means that\n\\[x = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{-64}}{8} = \\frac{-4 \\pm 8i}{8} = \\frac{1}{2}\\pm i\\]\nand these are the two roots of this quadratic equation.\n\n\nThe next example changes the name of the variable used. You should be able to recognise a quadratic equation in the wild, regardless of what symbol is used as the variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\n\nWhat are the roots of the quadratic equation \\(m^2 - m - 1 = 0\\)?\nHere, the quadratic equation is of the required form \\(am^2 + bm + c = 0\\) with \\(a = 1, b = -1\\) and \\(c = -1\\). Putting these into the quadratic formula gives:\n\\[ m = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - (-4)}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\]\nTherefore, the two roots of the quadratic equation are \\(m = (1 -\\sqrt{5})/2\\) and \\(m = (1 + \\sqrt{5})/2\\). (The second of these is a well-known mathematical constant known as the golden ratio)\n\n\nThe final two examples deal with changes of variable and also a change in the typical structure of a quadratic equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\n\nWhat are the roots of the equation \\(y^4 - 3y^2 + 2 =0\\)?\nYou can notice here that the equation given is not strictly a quadratic equation, as it is not of the form given in the definition above. However, by taking \\(y^2\\) as the variable instead of \\(y\\), you can rewrite this equation as\n\\[y^4 - 3y^2 + 2 = (y^2)^2 - 3y^2 + 2 = 0\\]\nand so this is a quadratic equation, with \\(y^2\\) as the variable. You can then use the quadratic formula with \\(y^2\\) as the variable, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -3\\) and \\(c = 2\\) to get\n\\[ y^2 = \\frac{-(-3) \\pm \\sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(1)(2)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 - 8}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\pm 1}{2}\\]\nTherefore, the two solutions for \\(y^2\\) are \\(y^2 = 2/2 = 1\\) and \\(y^2 = 4/2 = 2\\). This gives four solutions for \\(y\\), which are \\(y = 1, -1, \\sqrt{2}, -\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\n\nWhat are the solutions to the equation \\(4q - 13 = -3/q\\)?\nYou can notice here that this equation does not look like a quadratic equation at all; so some rearranging needs to be done. First of all, you can multiply both sides by \\(q\\) to get\n\\[4q^2 - 13q = -3\\]\nand so\n\\[4q^2 - 13q + 3 = 0\\]\nSo this really was a quadratic equation, with \\(a = 4\\), \\(b = -13\\) and \\(c = 3\\). Putting this into the quadratic formula gives \\[\\begin{align*}\nq &= \\frac{-(-13) \\pm \\sqrt{(-13)^2 - 4(4)(3)}}{2(4)} = \\frac{13 \\pm \\sqrt{169 - 48}}{8}\\\\[1em]\n&= \\frac{13 \\pm \\sqrt{121}}{8} = \\frac{13 \\pm 11}{8}\n\\end{align*}\\] Therefore, the two solutions to the equation are \\(q = 2/8 = 1/4\\) and \\(q = 24/8 = 3\\)."

    "section": "What is a quadratic equation?",
    "text": "What is a quadratic equation?\nOne of the most important types of an equation are quadratic equations; very generally speaking, these are equations that contain a squared term. These appear almost everywhere in mathematics, from modelling projectile motion in mechanics to describing circles, ellipses, parabolas and hyperbolas in 2D space. It is therefore crucial to be able to identify and solve quadratic equations.\nThis guide will focus quadratic equations in one variable, explain the shape of their graphs, and explains how to identify the variable and the coefficients of the equation. Then, the discriminant is defined, and the role of the discriminant in determining solutions to the quadratic equation is explained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition of quadratic equation, root\n\n\n\nA quadratic equation is an equation that can be rearranged into the form \\[ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\] where \\(x\\) is a variable and \\(a,b,c\\) are real numbers with \\(a \\neq 0\\).\nValues of \\(x\\) that satisfy the equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) are known as roots of the equation. Typically, roots of a quadratic are expressed in the form of the variable. So here, the roots of \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) are ‘roots in \\(x\\)’.\n\n\nHere, \\(a\\neq 0\\) as if it was, then the equation would no longer be a quadratic equation!\nThe general shape of a quadratic equation is known as a parabola. A figure of two parabolas is given in Figure 1; the left hand graph is if \\(a &gt; 0\\), whereas the right hand graph is when \\(a &lt; 0\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: A pair of parabolas. (left) A graph of a quadratic \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) where \\(a &gt; 0\\). (right) A graph of a quadratic \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) where \\(a &lt; 0\\).\n\n\nIt is very important to be able to identify the variable in a quadratic equation, as well as the coefficients \\(a,b,c\\). In the course of your mathematical study, it may be that the variable of a quadratic equation is not only letters like \\(x,y,z\\), but squares or cubes like \\(x^2\\) and \\(y^3\\), or even functions like \\(e^x\\), \\(\\cos(x)\\), and \\(\\sin(y)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n\nYou are given the quadratic equation \\(2x^2 + 4x - 8 = 0\\). The variable of the quadratic equation is \\(x\\), and the coefficients are \\(a = 2, b = 4, c = -8\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\n\nHere, the equation \\(y^4 - 10y^2 + 25 = 0\\) may look like a quartic equation, but it is actually a quadratic equation. Using the laws of indices, you can rewrite the equation as \\((y^2)^2 - 10y^2 + 25 = 0\\). Therefore, the variable of the quadratic equation is \\(y^2\\), and the coefficients are \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -10\\), \\(c = 25\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3\n\n\n\nYou are given the equation \\(-e^{2x} + 4e^{x} - 5 = 0\\). Using the laws of indices, you can rewrite the equation as \\(-(e^{x})^2 + 4e^x - 5 = 0\\). The variable of the quadratic equation is \\(e^x\\), and the coefficients are \\(a = -1\\), \\(b = 4\\), \\(c = -5\\). This is not the only solution to the coefficients; you can multiply the equation through by \\(-1\\) to get \\((e^{x})^2 - 4e^x + 5 = 0\\), which gives \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -4\\) and \\(c = 5\\). Both solutions are equally valid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 4\n\n\n\nYou are given the equation \\(t+1 = \\frac{4}{t-3}\\). This really is a quadratic equation! You can multiply both sides by \\(x - 3\\) to get \\[(t+1)(t+3) = 4\\] You can then expand the brackets to get \\[t^2 + t + 3t + 3 = 4\\] and so \\(t^2 + 4t + 3 = 4\\). Finally, you are able to subtract \\(4\\) from both sides to get \\(t^2 + 4t - 1 = 0\\). It follows that the variable of the quadratic equation is \\(t\\), and the coefficients are \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 4\\), \\(c = -1\\)."

See (Guide: Factorisation) for more.\nYou could complete the square in order to reduce the quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) into the form \\((x + b/2a)^2 = d\\), and then solve from there (not forgetting the negative root). See (Guide: Completing the square) for more.\nYou could use the quadratic formula; for a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), the two roots to the quadratic equation are given by \\[x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.\\]\n\nEach method is equally valid, but some may involve more work than others.

You can observe this behaviour on a graph in Figure 2; the parabola crosses the \\(x\\)-axis in two places.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: A pair of parabolas. (left) A graph of a quadratic \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) where \\(a &gt; 0\\) and \\(D &gt; 0\\). (right) A graph of a quadratic \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) where \\(a &lt; 0\\) and \\(D &gt; 0\\).\n\n\n\nIf \\(D = b^2 - 4ac = 0\\) is zero, then \\(\\sqrt{D} = 0\\). In this case, the two roots of the quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) are \\[x = \\frac{-b}{2a} \\qquad\\textsf{ and }\\qquad x = \\frac{-b}{2a}\\] These two roots are given by the same real number. To be sure that you express both roots, you can write ‘\\(x = -b/2a\\) twice’. You can observe this behaviour on a graph in Figure 3; the parabola touches the \\(x\\)-axis in exactly one place.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: A pair of parabolas. (left) A graph of a quadratic \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) where \\(a &gt; 0\\) and \\(D = 0\\). (right) A graph of a quadratic \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) where \\(a &lt; 0\\) and \\(D = 0\\).\n\n\n\nIf \\(D = b^2 - 4ac\\) is negative, then \\(\\sqrt{D}\\) is not a real number. In this case, the two roots of the quadratic equation are complex numbers. You can express the two roots of the quadratic equation by \\[x = \\frac{-b + i\\sqrt{-D}}{2a}\\qquad\\textsf{ and }\\qquad x = \\frac{-b - i\\sqrt{-D}}{2a}\\] where \\(i\\) is the imaginary unit (so \\(i^2 = -1\\); see (Guide: Introduction to complex numbers)). In a graph, the parabola does not cross the \\(x\\)-axis at all; this indicates that there are no real solutions to this quadratic equation. See Figure 4 for a picture.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: A pair of parabolas. (left) A graph of a quadratic \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) where \\(a &gt; 0\\) and \\(D &gt; 0\\). (right) A graph of a quadratic \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) where \\(a &lt; 0\\) and \\(D &lt; 0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou can use the discriminant to check how many roots a quadratic equation has in the variable given to you. However, this is at most a maximum number of solutions. Conditions on that variable may also reduce the number of valid solutions, particularly if you have real valued functions. For instance, since \\(e^x &gt; 0\\) for all real number \\(x\\), there are no solutions in \\(x\\) if you find \\(e^x = -1\\).\n\n\nHere’s some examples of using the discriminant and known properties of functions to rule out solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 5\n\n\n\nIn Example 1, you identified the coefficients of \\(2x^2 + 4x - 8 = 0\\) as \\(a = 2, b = 4, c = -8\\). Using these, you can work out the value of the discriminant \\(D = b^2 - 4ac\\) as \\[D = (4)^2 - 4(2)(-8) = 16 + 64 = 80.\\] Since \\(D = 80\\), you can say that this quadratic equation has two distinct real roots in \\(x = r_1\\) and \\(x = r_2\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6\n\n\n\nIn Example 2, you identified the coefficients of \\(y^4 - 10y^2 + 25 = 0\\) as \\(a = 1, b = -10, c = 25\\), and the variable as \\(y^2\\). Using these, you can work out the value of the discriminant \\(D = b^2 - 4ac\\) as \\[D = (-10)^2 - 4(1)(25) = 100 - 100 = 0.\\] Since \\(D = 0\\), you can say that this quadratic equation has at most one real root \\(r\\) in terms of \\(y^2\\).\nWhether or not the equation itself has real solutions in \\(y\\) depends on whether \\(r\\) is positive or negative! You cannot take the square root of a negative number, so if \\(r\\) is negative the equation has no real solutions. If \\(r\\) is positive, then the equation has two real roots in \\(y\\); that is, \\(y = \\pm\\sqrt{r}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 7\n\n\n\nIn Example 3, you identified the coefficients of \\(-e^{2x} + 4e^{x} - 5 = 0\\) as \\(a = -1, b = 4, c = -5\\), and the variable as \\(e^{x}\\). Using these, you can work out the value of the discriminant \\(D = b^2 - 4ac\\) as \\[D = (4)^2 - 4(-1)(-5) = 16 - 20 = -4.\\] Since \\(D = -4\\), you can say that this quadratic equation has complex roots.\nThis equation therefore has no real solutions in \\(x\\). This is because \\(e^x\\) is real for any real \\(x\\); if \\(e^x\\) is complex, it follows that \\(x\\) cannot be real.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 8\n\n\n\nIn Example 4, you rearranged the equation \\(t+1 = \\frac{4}{t-3}\\) to \\(t^2 + 4t - 1 = 0\\), and therefore identifed the coefficients as \\(a = 1, b = 4, c = -1\\), and the variable as \\(t\\). Using these, you can work out the value of the discriminant \\(D = b^2 - 4ac\\) as \\[D = (4)^2 - 4(1)(-1) = 16 + 4 = 20.\\] Since \\(D = 20\\), you can say that this quadratic equation has two distinct real roots in \\(t\\)."
