## Why? {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- **traditional textbooks**

    - can be difficult to parse, particularly for non-specialists
    - can be technically inaccessible and also expensive!

- **pandemic!**

    - sudden shift to online resources for self-study
    - inconsistent standards in pre-university education
    
- **diverse backgrounds**

    - every country has their own curriculum
    
- **School need**

## Solution {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- creating a bank of **free-to-use, high-quality bank of inclusive and technically accessible learning resources in mathematics and statistics.** 

    - in addition **involving students** gives learners agency in their resource creation, teaches transferable skills, obtains diverse perspectives on learning...

## How? {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- **inclusive**: strict guide on use of language ('you' not 'we', nothing easy, simple terms, minimal jargon, avoid context)

    - [*polemic written*](https://starmast.org/styleguide)

- **technically accessible**: available for use by all users (screen readable, printable, editable)

    - *use of Quarto, outputs to html/word/pdf simultaneously*
    
- **free-to-use**: available anywhere at any time, with no cost

    - [*website, CC licensed*](https://starmast.org/license)
    
## Structure {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

for **each topic**:

- **study guide**

    - explains the key concepts 
    - contains many examples
    - quick-check problems at the end

- **question sheet** and **answer sheet**

- **printable pdf version** and **editable/screen-readable Word version** provided as standard

[also other resources such as **fact** and **proof** sheets]

## First go: STEP project {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- started summer of 2023, aiming for release September 2023
- two teams of 7 students each producing 12 guides between them, working in smaller teams or individually
    - topics included *rearranging equations, sigma notation, indices and logarithms, trigonometry, vectors*
- one graduate coach

## Result {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

**partial success**

- **yes!**

    - all requested resources created
    - students satisfied with impactful work
    - framework in place
    
- **but**
    
    - inconsistent quality
    - some parts missing
    - some over-complications

## What went right? {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- **for me**

    - something to work with!
    - plenty of questions and answers
    - basis for expansion
    - lots of student interest
    
- **for students**

    - important and impactful project
    - good opportunity for transferable skills
    - won something(?) at STEP awards

## What went wrong? {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- **for me**

    - disconnected from project
    - dissatisfied with outputs
    - took time to put things right
    
- **for students**

    - little time to communicate with me about what was needed
    - long time to see publication (resources released May 2024)

## Second go: VIP {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

perfect for a VIP!

- **small group, weekly meetings, supervisor involvement**

- **attracting wide range of students**

    - mathematicians, statisticians, economists, cell biologists, computer scientists...

- **assessment**

    - 20% fortnightly reflective logs
    - 30% posters and group presentation
    - 50% final portfolio and reflective report

## VIP inputs from students {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- **website backend**: domain name, security, search engine optimisation, hosting, custom website style, cookies, analytics, feedback boxes, emails...

- **branding and marketing**: colour scheme, logo, outreach plans, social media account (follow us [@starmast_ on instagram](https://www.instagram.com/starmast_/)), ads and posters...

- **accessibility work**: automatic narration of guides, interactive figures (flow-chart for hypothesis testing), built-in graphical calculators (desmos)...

- **more content**: algebra, complex numbers, statistics, linear algebra, partial differentiation...

## Future plans {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- **more content**

    - *30+ guides* hopefully by end of summer (and then more than that).
    - videos, podcasts, interactivity...

- **get the site out there!**

    - market inside the University (in presentations like this one, VIP conferences)
    - market outside the University (maths support networks [next Thu], schools, libraries...)
    
- **way off in the distance**: funding, social enterprise(?)
