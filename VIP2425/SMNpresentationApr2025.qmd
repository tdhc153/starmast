## About me {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- Lecturer (Education Focused) at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews

- passionate about language and accessibility in mathematics and statistics

- enjoys cricket, coffee, and crosswords

## Problem {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

**need for accessible maths and stats resources**

- **traditional textbooks** can be difficult to parse for non-specialists, technically inaccessible, expensive, intimidating...

- **pandemic**: sudden shift to online resources for self-study, inconsistent standards in pre-university education, no library access...
    
- **diverse backgrounds**: every country has their own curriculum, language; Masters courses attract wide backgrounds of students...

## Solution {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- creating a **free-to-use, high-quality bank of inclusive and technically accessible learning resources in mathematics and statistics** 

    - in addition **involving students** gives learners agency in their resource creation, teaches transferable skills not often found in maths and stats degrees, obtains diverse perspectives on learning...
    
- end product: [**STARMAST (starmast.org)**](https://starmast.org) - **St** **A**ndrews **R**esources in **Ma**thematics and **St**atistics

## How? {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- **inclusive**: strict guide on use of language ('you' not 'we', nothing easy, simple terms, minimal jargon, avoid context)

    - [*polemic written*](https://starmast.org/styleguide)

- **technically accessible**: available for use by all users (screen readable, printable, editable)

    - *use of Quarto, outputs to html/word/pdf simultaneously*
    
- **free-to-use**: available anywhere at any time, with no cost

    - [*website, CC licensed*](https://starmast.org/license)
    
## Structure {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

for **each topic**:

- **study guide**: explains the key concepts, contains many examples (and figures, usually Desmos), quick-check problems at the end

- **question sheet** and **answer sheet**

- **printable pdf version** and **editable/screen-readable Word version** provided as standard

- **mp3 narration** (now being rolled out)

[also other resources such as **fact** and **proof** sheets]

## Mechanism: VIP (1/2) {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

[**V**ertically **I**ntegrated **P**roject:](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/education/vip/projects/)

- multi-year, multi-semester ongoing **research project** (with some leeway)

- students in **any year** can apply

- awards **module credits**, and students get a grade for their work

- allows students to **participate in the same project across multiple years**
    
## Mechanism: VIP (2/2) {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

our VIP:

- **small group, weekly meetings, hands-on supervisor involvement**

- **attracting wide range of students**

    - mathematicians, statisticians, economists, cell biologists, computer scientists, art historians...
    - from first-years to final years

- **assessment**: 20% fortnightly reflective logs, 30% posters and group presentation, 50% final portfolio and reflective report
    
## VIP inputs from students {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- **website backend**: domain name, security, search engine optimisation, hosting, custom website style, cookies, analytics, feedback boxes, emails...

- **branding and marketing**: colour scheme, logo, outreach plans, social media account (follow us [@starmast_ on instagram](https://www.instagram.com/starmast_/)), ads and posters...

- **accessibility work**: automatic narration of guides, interactive figures (flow-chart for hypothesis testing), built-in graphical calculators (desmos)...

- **content**: guides on algebra, geometry, calculus, stats...

## Future plans {data-background-image="slides-bg.png"}

- **more content**

    - *30+ guides* hopefully by end of summer (and then more than that).
    - videos, podcasts, interactivity...

- **get the site out there!**

    - market inside the University and outside the University (conferences, maths support networks :), schools, libraries...)
    
- **way off in the distance**: funding, social enterprise(?)
