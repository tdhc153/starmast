Answers are given in exact for\n\n1.1 For $sin(x)=\\frac{\\sqrt2}{2}$, x is equal to $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ or 0.785.\n1.2 For $cos(2x+1)=\\frac{1}{2}$, x is equal to $\\frac{\\pi-3}{6}$ or 0.0234.\n1.3 For $tan(5x-1)=\\frac{\\sqrt2}{2}$, x is equal to 0.323.\n1.4 For $cos(x^2+4x+3)=1$, x is equal to -1 or -3. To do this, you use that $cos^{-1}(1)=0$ and so you need to solve the quadratic equation $x^2+4x+3=0$. \n\n\n",
